An experimental conference format that reimagines how knowledge exchange can happen.

## Format

A party-based event structure combining art-making with conversation, organized into four sections:

- **Point**
- **Line**
- **Space**
- **Time**

## Structure

- Extended land acknowledgment at opening
- Participants invited to change positions throughout
- Sharing trajectories through concepts
- Non-linear navigation based on interest

## Philosophy

Rather than passive audiences listening to presentations, all attendees participate as active contributors, following threads of curiosity rather than predetermined schedules.
