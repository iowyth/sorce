## About

Show-and-Tell sessions are informal gatherings where artist-academics can share works-in-progress, ongoing research, or creative experiments in a supportive, low-pressure environment.

## Format

- Practitioners sign up to share (5-10 minutes each)
- Brief sharing followed by open discussion
- Casual networking and continued conversation

## Principles

- **Process over product** — Share where you are, not just finished work
- **Curiosity over critique** — Questions and connections rather than evaluations
- **Interdisciplinary exchange** — Finding unexpected links across practices

## Get Involved
