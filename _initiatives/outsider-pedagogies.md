status: Past

SORCE members iowyth hezel ulthiin and Miranda McKee defined research-creation as a valuable, momentum-gaining qualitative research methodology. Combining artistic and academic praxis, researchers use creative expression to investigate, co-create, develop and disseminate knowledge, ultimately challenging the limits of knowledge making itself.

The discussion explored research-creation's history, uses, strengths, and challenges through case studies and personal experience. Examined modalities included counter-mapping as liberatory data activism, participatory theatre for policy change, outsider improv spaces as equitable praxis, and photography for climate activism.
