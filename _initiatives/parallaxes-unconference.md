The 2022 Parallaxes Unconference was the inaugural SORCE experiment. Deconstructing traditional modes of scholarship and sharing to create a horizontal and inclusive space for mutual discovery, our mission for the unconference was to "ask better questions."

## Participation

Over 30 co-creative participants gathered for a full-day event sharing practices and generating ideas about research-creation's role in their lives and interests.
