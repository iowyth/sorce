The Pirate Guide is a grassroots wiki owned and edited by ComCult students for ComCult Students. Emerging from the Ad Hoc Graduate Committee on Accessibility, the Pirate Guide is a central pool of resources meant to demystify graduate studies for those with intersectional identities.

## Why This Matters

This process of demystification was determined to be an important aspect of horizontal solidarity and a means of increasing the accessibility of graduate education.

## A Living Document

This is a living document, open to contributions and updates. The unofficial quality of this document enables students to share practical skills, tricks, and techniques for getting through the bureaucratic difficulties that come with working under an institutional framework.

## Our Approach

Our approach to liberatory methods is to create community access through informal infrastructures enabling small acts of care to become mobilized into broader processes of solidarity. This form of praxis enables a piecework approach to community infrastructure, creating a commons that empowers individuals to work towards collective goals. This guide is a form of a praxis meant to level power and hierarchies in higher-education by collectivizing the means to academic success.
