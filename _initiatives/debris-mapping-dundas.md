Artists Tricia Enns (Tioht:àke/Montréal) and Andrew Lochhead (Tkaronto/Toronto) led a two-hour workshop exploring walking and map-making using debris and handmade paper techniques.

## The Walk

Collecting debris while walking and learning the stories of what is now called Trinity-Bellwoods Park, Garrison Creek, and nearby Dundas Street, participants examined how discarded objects, like the land they are found on, connect to historic global trajectories of power that reverberate through our present day.

## The Making

The workshop combined scenographic walking, debris mapping, and paper-making to present hybrid chorography of Toronto spaces amid ongoing public memory debates.
