**SORCE** — Supportive Organic Reflexive Community/Creative Empowerment — is a research-creation collective based at T'karonto Metropolitan University and York University.

We work through open-ended, creative, empowering methods for pursuing justice and structural change, mixing deep philosophical work with grounded solutions through community activity.

---

## What We Do

SORCE hosts events, workshops, skill shares, and gatherings to:

- **Support** creative engagement within university contexts and beyond
- **Discuss** emerging research methodologies and ethical considerations
- **Showcase** member talent and creative work
- **Foster** liberation opportunities connecting universities with broader communities

We embrace diverse perspectives and work to build connections among marginalized communities and their allies through what scholars call *transverse politics*.

---

## How We Work

SORCE operates on a **horizontal model** where members maintain semi-autonomous roles while engaging in mutual support. We move theory into praxis through creative, iterative, community activity.

### Participation

Participation is flexible — involvement can range from observation to leadership. We welcome:

- Masters students
- Doctoral candidates
- Artists
- Community allies

There are no rigid requirements. Come as you are, contribute what you can.
