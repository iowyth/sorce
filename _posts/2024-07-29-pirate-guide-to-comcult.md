We're thrilled to share the **Pirate Guide to ComCult** — a grassroots wiki created by graduate students addressing accessibility in academic studies.

## About the Guide

The Pirate Guide is a community-maintained resource that provides practical, honest guidance for navigating graduate programs in communication and cultural studies. Created by and for students, it addresses the gaps often left by official institutional resources.

## What You'll Find

- **Navigating the program**: Unofficial advice on coursework, exams, and timelines
- **Funding and resources**: Tips for finding support beyond official channels
- **Accessibility**: Information on accommodations and inclusive practices
- **Community knowledge**: Wisdom passed down from cohort to cohort

## Why "Pirate"?

The name reflects the guide's grassroots, DIY ethos — knowledge shared freely outside official channels, by those who've been there.

## Contribute

The Pirate Guide is a living document. If you have experience to share, consider contributing your knowledge to help future students navigate the waters.

## Access

Visit the guide through our [Resources]({{ '/resources/' | relative_url }}) page.
