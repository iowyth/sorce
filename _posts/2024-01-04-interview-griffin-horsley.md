An interview with ComCult Master's student Griffin Horsley examining research-creation practices.

## On Coming to Knowledge

The conversation explores how Griffin comes to knowledge through the processes of research-creation, examining his thesis work and the methodologies that shape his scholarly inquiry.

## Research-Creation as Process
