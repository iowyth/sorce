This interview explores **Griffin Horsley's** research-creation thesis, which emerged from his inheritance of objects following his grandmother's passing at the start of COVID-19. Rather than writing about museum policy as originally planned, Horsley pivoted to examining his affective relationship with inherited domestic items through scanner-based image-making.

## The Scanner Way of Thinking

Horsley creates wraparound images by rolling his grandmother's objects across a flatbed scanner. As he explains, "the scanner only has a couple of millimetres to see in front of itself," creating distorted, abstracted representations where colors become washed out and textures blur.

This technical limitation becomes conceptually productive. The degraded images mirror memory's inevitable fading — the way details slip away even as we try to preserve them. The scanner doesn't capture objects as they "really are" but transforms them through its own mechanical constraints, much as grief transforms our relationship to those we've lost.

## Necromancy as Method

Horsley deliberately uses the term "necromancy" to describe his practice, framing it as spiritually-inflected mediumship with inherited objects. This terminology acknowledges both the emancipatory potential and ethical dangers of such work.

"There is a hubristic element, a pursuit of knowledge," he notes, that risks possessiveness — the desire to hold onto what's gone, to control memory rather than letting it transform us. Yet the same practice offers resistance to institutional commodification of grief, refusing the sanitized mourning that capitalism permits.

## The Super-Normal

Our conversation kept returning to what we might call the "super-normal" rather than supernatural: ordinary experiences of grief, attachment, and material relationality rendered visible through creative practice. Research-creation, at its best, articulates urgent personal feeling within academic structures without domesticating that feeling into acceptable scholarly discourse.

The earnest emotional engagement that Horsley brings to his grandmother's objects resists institutional capture precisely because it refuses ironic distance. The work is embarrassingly sincere in ways that academic convention typically forbids.

## Process Over Product

For Horsley, research-creation isn't a method you apply to pre-existing questions but a way of allowing questions to emerge through making. His thesis pivoted entirely because the practice of scanning these objects revealed something his original topic couldn't address: the specific weight of inheriting a material world from someone who's gone.

The scanner images aren't illustrations of theoretical arguments about hauntology and material culture. They're the site where those arguments become thinkable at all.

## On Earnestness

We discussed how research-creation creates space for kinds of intellectual work that conventional academic genres exclude. The affective intensity of Horsley's project — the genuine grief that motivates it — would read as inappropriate in a standard thesis. Research-creation provides a container where that intensity becomes methodologically legitimate.

This isn't about making academic work "more personal" in some therapeutic sense. It's about recognizing that knowledge always emerges from situated, embodied, emotionally-invested positions — and developing scholarly forms that acknowledge rather than obscure this fact.
