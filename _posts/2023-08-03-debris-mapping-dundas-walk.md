SORCE members **Andrew Lochhead** and collaborator **Tricia Enns** (Montréal) facilitated a participatory workshop exploring urban waste and spatial narratives through walking and papermaking. The two-hour session addressed issues of urban space, waste, memory, and the politics of place.

## The Walk: Trinity-Bellwoods to Dundas West

Participants gathered in Trinity-Bellwoods Park to explore the landscape while collecting discarded materials that "leapt out" at them. The facilitators shared historical context about the area, including what they called the "hidden" aspects of the park — histories and presences not immediately visible to casual visitors.

As materials accumulated, participants shared their findings with one another. There was joy and even envy at the interesting garbage discovered along the route. One notable moment: a Portuguese cigarette package was recognized from a participant's earlier visit to Portugal — debris as unexpected connection across geographies.

## Debris as Archive

What can trash tell us about a place? Discarded objects carry information that official archives exclude: what people consumed, what they threw away, what moved through this space and was left behind. Attending to debris means attending to a different kind of historical record — one that's accidental, partial, and constantly being produced and erased.

The walk followed Garrison Creek (now buried beneath the city) and moved along Dundas Street West. This route was deliberate. Lochhead's broader work includes leading the campaign to rename Toronto's Dundas Street over its connections to slavery and genocide — Henry Dundas, the street's namesake, delayed the abolition of slavery in the British Empire. Walking this street while attending to its debris layers contemporary waste over contested historical memory.

## Making Paper from What's Left

Returning indoors, facilitators guided participants through handmade paper creation. Collected debris was embedded into wet paper fiber suspended on screens, transforming discarded objects into permanent artifacts. Each participant took home a cured paper work containing their debris collection — a material record of their encounter with the space and its remains.

This process literalizes the transformation of waste into artifact, of scattered debris into coherent form. The paper doesn't represent the walk; it contains it.

## Alternative Cartographies

The workshop produced what might be called alternative maps — visualizations emphasizing spatial narratives and stories rather than roads and ownership boundaries. These maps document personal relationships to location and landscape rather than claiming objective representation.

Official maps enforce particular ways of seeing space: property lines, street names, transit routes. Debris maps propose different questions: What accumulates here? What gets left behind? What stories do discarded objects tell about who moves through this space and under what conditions?

## Walking as Method

The workshop exemplifies walking as research methodology — a practice with deep roots in psychogeography, situationist practice, and Indigenous land-based knowledge. Walking refuses the abstraction of studying space from a distance. You encounter urban space through your feet, your breath, your attention to what's underfoot.

Combined with collection and making, walking becomes a way of producing knowledge rather than just observing. The debris map isn't a document of what was already known but a record of what emerged through embodied engagement with place.
