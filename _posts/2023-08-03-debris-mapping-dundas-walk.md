A walking workshop led by SORCE member Andrew Lochhead and collaborator Tricia Enns.

## About the Walk

Participants explored trash and what we are to make of the remains left all around us during a guided walk through Trinity-Bellwoods Park and along Dundas Street West.

## Method

The workshop combined:
- Guided walking through urban space
- Debris collection along the route
- Handmade paper techniques using found materials
- Collaborative mapping of memory and place

## Questions Explored

- What stories do discarded objects tell about a place?
- How do material remains carry memory?
- What politics of place emerge from attending to waste?
- How can walking function as research method?

## Context

Andrew Lochhead's broader work includes leading the campaign to rename Toronto's Dundas Street over its connections to slavery and genocide — making this walk through Dundas Street West particularly resonant with questions of memory, naming, and urban space.
