SORCE Collective creates opportunities for artist-academics to connect, reflect, and share their practices in the hopes of fostering creative collaborations and interdisciplinary outputs. Our **Show-and-Tell** sessions embody this mission through open-ended, social gatherings designed to explore the intersection points among participants' creative work.

## Finding Resonance Across Practices

Show-and-Tell operates on a simple premise: when researchers and creators share their work-in-progress in informal settings, unexpected connections emerge. A textile artist discovers conceptual overlap with a sound researcher. A photographer finds methodological kinship with someone working in participatory theatre. These intersection points often become the seeds of future collaboration.

Unlike formal presentations or critiques, Show-and-Tell prioritizes:

- **Process over product** — Share where you are, not just polished outcomes
- **Curiosity over critique** — Questions and connections rather than evaluations
- **Interdisciplinary exchange** — Finding unexpected resonances across practices
- **Social atmosphere** — Informal gathering rather than academic performance

## The Format

Sessions are intentionally unstructured. Participants who wish to share are given brief windows (5-10 minutes) to present whatever feels relevant — a question they're wrestling with, an experiment that failed productively, a material they're exploring, a theoretical thread they're following.

What follows isn't critique but conversation: What does this remind you of? Have you encountered this elsewhere? What would happen if...?

The goal isn't to evaluate work but to generate connections — between ideas, between people, between disciplines that rarely speak to one another within institutional structures.

## Why This Matters

Academic environments often isolate researchers within disciplinary silos. Feedback typically arrives through formal channels: committee meetings, peer review, conference Q&As. These structures serve important purposes, but they can also constrain the kinds of conversations that spark genuine collaboration.

Show-and-Tell creates space for the informal exchange that institutions often lack — the hallway conversation, the studio visit, the "have you seen this?" moment that can redirect entire projects.

## Join Us

Show-and-Tell sessions are open to all members of the SORCE network and those interested in joining. Sessions are held via Zoom to enable participation across geographic boundaries.
