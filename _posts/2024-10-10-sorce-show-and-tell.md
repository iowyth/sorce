We're excited to announce **SORCE Show-and-Tell** — open-ended social sessions for practitioners to share work and explore interdisciplinary connections.

## What is Show-and-Tell?

Show-and-Tell sessions are informal gatherings where artist-academics can share works-in-progress, ongoing research, or creative experiments in a supportive, low-pressure environment.

Unlike formal presentations or critiques, Show-and-Tell emphasizes:

- **Process over product** — Share where you are, not just finished work
- **Curiosity over critique** — Questions and connections rather than evaluations
- **Interdisciplinary exchange** — Finding unexpected links across practices

## How It Works

1. Practitioners sign up to share (5-10 minutes each)
2. Brief sharing followed by open discussion
3. Casual networking and continued conversation

## Join Us

Show-and-Tell sessions are open to all members of the SORCE network and those interested in joining.

Check our [Initiatives]({{ '/initiatives/' | relative_url }}) page for upcoming sessions, or [join the discussion](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/discussions) to propose topics.
