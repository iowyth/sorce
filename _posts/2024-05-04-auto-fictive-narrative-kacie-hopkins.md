A workshop invitation featuring SORCE member Kacie Hopkins discussing creative research approaches.

## About the Workshop

An interactive dialogue about Auto Fictive Narratives, where Hopkins explores her innovative, heart-centred approach to research centered on stitching as both craft and inquiry method.

## What is Auto-Fictive Narrative?

Auto-fictive narrative blends autobiographical material with fictional techniques, creating space for exploring personal experience through creative transformation. This approach allows researchers to engage with their own stories while maintaining critical distance and artistic form.

## Stitching as Method

Hopkins' practice uses stitching — the literal act of sewing and textile work — as a research methodology. The slowness of hand-stitching creates space for reflection, while the material traces of thread document the research process itself.
