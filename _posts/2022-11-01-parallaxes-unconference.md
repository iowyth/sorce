SORCE's inaugural experiment — a day-long event bringing together over 30 participants to explore research-creation practices.

## Format

The unconference emphasized a "no spectators" approach where all attendees participated as presenters. Sessions included:

- Praxis sharing
- Engaged workshops
- "Questing and questioning" discussions
- Lively theoretical examinations

## Philosophy

Parallaxes was organized around the mission to "ask better questions" through horizontal, inclusive inquiry. Rather than predetermined presentations, the event allowed topics and discussions to emerge from participant interests and expertise.

## What is an Unconference?

An unconference inverts traditional conference hierarchies. Instead of invited speakers presenting to passive audiences, all participants contribute. Sessions are proposed on the day, schedules are flexible, and the collective shapes the event's direction.

## Significance

As SORCE's first major event, Parallaxes established the collective's approach: experimental formats, horizontal participation, and research-creation as both topic and method.
