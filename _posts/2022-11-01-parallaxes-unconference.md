SORCE's inaugural experiment — a day-long gathering on November 10, 2022 at Toronto Metropolitan University exploring "Approaches to Research-Creation: Generating Questions." Over 30 participants engaged in what became a defining articulation of the collective's ethos: horizontal knowledge sharing, participatory formats, and research-creation as both topic and method.

## No Spectators

The unconference operated on a radical premise: everyone who attended also presented. This "no spectators" philosophy rejected the traditional conference model where experts deliver knowledge to passive audiences. Instead, all participants contributed their questions, practices, and uncertainties.

This approach intentionally centered voices that academic conferences often marginalize: BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, mad/Deaf/disabled, and neurodiverse perspectives. The horizontal structure wasn't just format preference but political commitment — a refusal of the hierarchies that determine whose knowledge counts.

## Streams and Sessions

The day organized itself into multiple streams:

**Praxis Sharing** — Participants exchanged methodologies and approaches not as finished products but as ongoing experiments. What are you trying? What isn't working? What questions does your practice generate that you can't yet answer?

**Engaged Workshops** — Hands-on sessions that questioned what constitutes valid research. Rather than discussing making, participants made together — discovering through collective practice what individual reflection might miss.

**Facilitated Conversations** — Structured dialogues exploring research-creation practices, their institutional contexts, and their transformative potential.

**Artistic Interventions** — Sessions that subverted traditional academic tools and processes, using creative disruption to open new ways of thinking.

## Making Together

Morning sessions involved collaborative art-making where participants used unconventional materials — coffee, beet slices — to decorate surfaces beyond paper. The materials weren't chosen for their conventionality but for their aliveness, their capacity to surprise.

Participants engaged in discussions of "the art of letting go," accompanied by musical elements. The making wasn't illustration of concepts but generation of them — ideas emerging through material engagement that couldn't have been thought in advance.

## The Zine Workshop

A central session invited participants to create a "Research-Creation Manifesto" through zine-making. This tactile engagement with collective statement-making required negotiating shared supplies, making decisions together, and accepting the messy vitality of collaborative creation.

The manifesto that emerged wasn't a polished document but an artifact of process — bearing the marks of multiple hands, multiple perspectives, multiple moments of agreement and productive disagreement.

## What We Talked About

Thematic threads wove through the day: migration and displacement, the meaning of home, the productivity of failure, grounding oneself amid turbulence. These weren't predetermined topics but what emerged when diverse practitioners gathered around shared questions.

One participant articulated research-creation as "people trying to find a still place inside of themselves" to share with others. This formulation captures something essential: the work isn't just intellectual but existential, not just making knowledge but making conditions for presence.

## Why "Parallaxes"?

A parallax is the apparent displacement of an object when viewed from different positions. The name signals the unconference's core insight: research-creation looks different depending on where you stand. There's no view from nowhere, no neutral perspective. By gathering multiple positions, we see not consensus but the productive tensions between ways of knowing.

## Significance

As SORCE's first major event, Parallaxes established patterns that continue to shape the collective: experimental formats over conventional ones, participation over spectatorship, questions over answers, process over product.

The unconference demonstrated that another way of gathering is possible — that academic events can be sites of genuine exchange rather than performance, of collective thinking rather than individual display.
