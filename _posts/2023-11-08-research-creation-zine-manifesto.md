A collaborative zine project led by Tesni Ellis and Zoë Martin, emerging from the SORCE unconference.

## The Project

Participants received a wide variety of artistic materials and created pages as a tactile response to conversations about research-creation methodology.

## Process

The zine emerged organically from unconference discussions, with each contributor responding to the themes and questions that arose through material making. Rather than writing about research-creation, participants enacted it — creating visual and textual responses through collage, drawing, writing, and assemblage.

## Why Zines?

Zines offer a democratic, accessible format for sharing knowledge outside traditional academic channels. They're cheap to produce, easy to distribute, and invite DIY participation. For SORCE, the zine form aligns with our commitment to horizontal knowledge-sharing and creative methodology.
