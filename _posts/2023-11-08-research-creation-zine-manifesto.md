This project was led by **Tesni Ellis** & **Zoë Martin**

Emerging from the SORCE unconference, the manifesto for Research-Creation was constructed as a tactile response to a conversation about research-creation. Each participant in the conversation had access to a wide variety of artistic materials and was invited to construct pages inspired by the exploration occurring during the process of making.
