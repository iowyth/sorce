The SORCE Collective developed an innovative **zine manifesto** that emerged from our unconference focused on research-creation practices. Led by **Tesni Ellis** and **Zoë Martin**, this tactile project transformed theoretical discussion into hands-on creative production — demonstrating research-creation methodology by enacting it.

## Making While Thinking

The methodology was participatory and simultaneous: each participant in the conversation had access to a wide variety of artistic materials and was invited to construct pages inspired by the exploration occurring during the process of making.

This wasn't a two-step process where we first discussed research-creation and then illustrated those discussions. The making happened *during* the conversation. Participants collaged, drew, wrote, and assembled while talking, allowing the material practice to shape the discussion as much as the discussion shaped the material practice.

## Why This Approach?

A traditional manifesto declares positions through written argument. But research-creation challenges the assumption that knowledge best travels through text. What would a manifesto look like that emerged from making rather than just writing? What positions might become articulable through collage, texture, and visual composition that can't be captured in prose?

The co-created zine manifesto doesn't merely *describe* research-creation practice — it *embodies* it. The form and the content are inseparable.

## The Resulting Collection

The zine includes multiple illustrated pages created through this collaborative process. Each page represents a different participant's visual response to the conversation, demonstrating the diverse ways practitioners interpret and enact research-creation methodology.

Some pages are dense with layered imagery; others are sparse and gestural. Some incorporate text heavily; others let image carry the meaning. This heterogeneity isn't a problem to be resolved but a feature of collective knowledge-making — different perspectives rendered materially visible rather than synthesized into false consensus.

## Why Zines?

Zines offer a democratic, accessible format for sharing knowledge outside traditional academic channels:

- **Cheap to produce**: No gatekeepers, no production budgets, no institutional approval
- **Easy to distribute**: Can be photocopied, handed out, left in free piles
- **DIY ethic**: Invites participation rather than passive consumption
- **Impermanent and iterable**: Not precious objects but working documents

For SORCE, the zine form aligns with our commitment to horizontal knowledge-sharing. Academic journals create artificial scarcity and enforce stylistic norms that exclude many ways of knowing. Zines refuse those constraints.

## Research-Creation as Methodology

This project exemplifies what Chapman and Sawchuk call the "family resemblances" among research-creation practices: not a single method but a constellation of approaches that share certain commitments — to making as inquiry, to practice as knowledge-production, to forms that don't separate research from creation.

The zine manifesto isn't an illustration of these ideas but an instance of them. Anyone encountering the document encounters research-creation directly, not as concept but as material artifact.
