**Format:** Online via Zoom (free)

## Assembling Methodology from Living

This panel emerged from collaborative conversations exploring research-creation methodologies grounded in personal experience outside traditional academia. The speakers aimed to assemble a methodology for research that engages with Decolonial and Indigenous ways of knowing, drawing on what might be called "acts of living" as a knowledge-building source.

Central to this discussion: accepting the human approach to knowledge building that emerges from a direct relationship with the world. This isn't about applying external theoretical frameworks to experience but about recognizing experience itself as theory-generating.

## Case Studies in Outsider Pedagogy

The panelists explored several concrete practices:

**Counter-mapping** — Challenging dominant cartographic representations by creating alternative maps that center marginalized perspectives, contested histories, and suppressed geographies. Maps are never neutral; counter-mapping makes that politics visible while proposing different ways of representing space.

**Participatory theatre** — Using embodied, collective performance as research method. Rather than studying communities from outside, participatory theatre involves community members as co-creators, generating knowledge through shared enactment rather than extraction.

**Improv spaces** — Emergent, unscripted collaborative practice as a site of knowledge production. Improvisation refuses the separation between thinking and doing, between preparation and performance. What can be known through collective improvisation that can't be known through individual reflection?

**Photography for climate activism** — Visual practice as both documentation and intervention. How can image-making serve movements for climate justice? What ethical considerations arise when art enters activist contexts?

## Why "Outsider"?

The term signals a positioning relative to institutional academic norms. These pedagogies emerge from experience that academia has historically excluded or devalued: embodied knowledge, community-based practice, creative work that doesn't separate research from action.

"Outsider" isn't a permanent identity but a relationship to institutional power. The goal isn't to remain outside but to transform what counts as inside — to expand academic recognition of diverse ways of knowing.

## Research-Creation and Social Change

The panel addressed a persistent question: can research-creation contribute to social justice movements, or does institutionalization inevitably domesticate radical practice?

There's no easy answer. Institutions absorb and neutralize; that's what they do. But research-creation also creates space for kinds of work that couldn't otherwise exist within academic structures. The tension is productive — not something to be resolved but to be inhabited thoughtfully.
