A dialogue between iowyth hezel ulthiin and Megan Hughes exploring research as oral teachings.

## On Research as Oral Teaching

This conversation explores our individual research methodologies as representing ways of making and doing life. Articulating these approaches forms the fundamental grounding of what and how we operate as researcher-creators.

## Topics Explored

- Research methodologies as life practices
- The relationship between making and knowing
- How we articulate our approaches to others
- The role of dialogue in understanding our own work

## Format

Rather than a formal interview, this piece takes the form of a conversation — two practitioners sharing and reflecting on their approaches through dialogue.
