A dialogue between **iowyth hezel ulthiin** and **Megan Hughes** exploring research methodologies as ways of making and doing life. Hughes, a milliner and creative researcher, recently completed her Master's thesis investigating making as personal secular ritual.

## The Hands That Know

Hughes comes to research-creation through hat-making, though her professional path has wound through data analysis for government and elementary education. What threads these experiences together isn't medium but method: "using my hands, resolving what's in my mind as a physical artefact" flows through all her work, even when not making something specific.

This isn't craft as hobby but craft as epistemology — a way of knowing that happens through material engagement rather than prior to it.

## The Everyday Divine

Hughes's thesis investigated her daily making practice as personal secular ritual. The project, which she calls "the everyday divine," discovered connections between craft, wellbeing, and transformation. "Making helps me relieve mental anguish," she notes, while simultaneously calming and increasing wellbeing.

This positions making as a "wellbeing modality" — drawing parallels to art therapy, psychology, and ritual studies. The act of making becomes not just productive but therapeutic, not just creative but sacred in its dailiness.

## New Materialist Perspectives

Central to Hughes's methodology is what she calls "a new materialist perspective" — treating materials as equal partners rather than passive substrates awaiting human intention. This isn't metaphor. Materials "speak" when allowed freedom. Scrap-based experiments teach "new ways to handle materials" that predetermined design would never reveal.

This approach yielded tangible results: Hughes won first place in a British millinery competition using what she calls a "free-form discovery approach," creating pieces without advance plans. The materials participated in their own becoming.

## Process Over Product

The conversation kept returning to the rejection of product-focused outcomes. Hughes explains that theoretical thinking and material making occur simultaneously — "a twin process" — where making inspires new questions while research provides new exploratory directions.

This distinction matters. Research-creation isn't making things to illustrate ideas you already have. It's thinking-through-making, where the thinking and the making are inseparable, each generating the other in real time.

## On Mistakes and Risk

Both discussants acknowledged that this methodology involves risk. Hughes notes receiving judgment from mentors about unconventional material choices but maintains that "mistakes" often yield valuable discoveries. Failed pieces become "problems to be solved" rather than waste.

This reframing is essential to research-creation: what institutions call failure, practitioners recognize as data. The experiment that doesn't produce expected results still produces results.

## The Zone

Hughes references athletes' concept of "the zone" — that centered focus where ego dissolves and one becomes part of a larger system. She suggests everyone can access this state of heightened presence and creative flow, and that making provides a reliable pathway there.

This isn't mysticism but phenomenology: the documented experience of absorption in skilled activity, where self-consciousness falls away and something else becomes possible.

## Materiality and Magic

Both discussants characterize their work as discovering something "magical" through sustained engagement. Hughes defines magic as "science that they haven't been able to replicate yet" — not supernatural but not-yet-understood, the zone where experience outpaces explanation.

Research-creation lives in this gap: rigorous enough to satisfy academic requirements, open enough to accommodate what can't be fully articulated.

## The Unbearable Moment

Hughes identifies the crucial but elusive moment of creative impulse: "an almost unbearable feeling, perching on the lip of conception." Something wants to exist but doesn't yet. The maker feels it before understanding it.

She locates research-creation's power in how "space and time and availability meet with the will and inspiration" — the conditions for transformative experience that no methodology can guarantee but that practices can cultivate.
