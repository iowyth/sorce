Dear SORCE Community and Beyond,

We are excited to extend an invitation to individuals interested in collaborative event-planning and experiencing non-hierarchical organizational dynamics within the framework of social justice.

## About Us

We are SORCE (Symbiotic Ontological Reflexive Community Emancipation), a research-creation collective at T'karonto Metropolitan University and York University. We bring forward the knowledge that our learning environment has been built by settlers on the traditional territories of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation in the Dish with One Spoon Territory and our hope in a return to collective water and land rights that respect our ecological responsibilities. Our collective passionately supports creative research in graduate programs, addressing gaps often left in academic settings around collective support and creative feedback. We strive to push the boundaries of the academy by encouraging non-traditional methods of knowledge creation and dissemination. SORCE hosts events, skill-shares and talks, conducts interviews, creates artwork, and provides resources and peer mentorship to:

- Support rigorous, philosophically grounded, and socially just creative practices in higher education
- Create a space for discussing emergent methodologies and ethical questions in research-creation and related fields
- Regularly showcase the work of our members at ongoing and completed stages
- Create opportunities for collaboration beyond institutions and departments to the greater community

## Why Participate

- Gain hands-on experience in event planning and community facilitation
- Contribute to a meaningful project that aligns with a commitment to creative exploration and social justice
- Learn and practice non-hierarchical organizational principles
- Connect with like-minded individuals who value collaboration for positive social impact

## How to Get Involved

If you share our passion for creative exploration, social justice, and collaborative organization, we invite you to join us!

We have two levels of commitment:

1. **Organizational Collective**
2. **Friendship Circle**

We don't require our friends to commit to a specific level of participation, so watch, engage, lead — it's up to you.
