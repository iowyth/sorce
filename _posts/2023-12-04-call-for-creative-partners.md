SORCE Collective is seeking creative partners for event planning and community organizing work grounded in social justice principles. We're looking for collaborators interested in practicing non-hierarchical organizational dynamics — not as abstract ideal but as lived experiment.

## Who We Are

SORCE (Supportive Organic Reflexive Community/Creative Empowerment) operates as a research-creation collective based at Toronto Metropolitan University and York University, on the traditional territories of the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation in the Dish with One Spoon Territory.

Our core mission centers on supporting creative research in graduate programs while filling gaps in academic environments regarding collective support and feedback mechanisms. We aim to support rigorous, philosophically grounded, and socially just creative practices in higher education.

## What We Do

SORCE hosts events, skill-shares, talks, and interviews while creating artwork and providing mentorship. Our work moves theory into praxis through creative, iterative, horizontal community activity. We believe that how we organize is as important as what we organize for — that prefigurative politics means building the structures we want to see within our current conditions.

## What We're Looking For

We're seeking creative partners who are interested in:

- **Non-hierarchical organizing**: Practicing horizontal decision-making, distributed leadership, and consensus-based processes
- **Social justice frameworks**: Grounding event planning in accessibility, anti-oppression, and community accountability
- **Research-creation methodologies**: Integrating artistic practice with scholarly inquiry
- **Collaborative facilitation**: Creating spaces where diverse participants can contribute meaningfully

## Participation Structures

SORCE offers two levels of involvement:

**Organizational Collective**: More active engagement in planning, decision-making, and facilitation. This isn't a leadership position in the traditional sense but a commitment to showing up for the ongoing work of maintaining collective infrastructure.

**Friendship Circle**: Lighter-touch involvement — attending events, contributing when capacity allows, staying connected without ongoing obligations.

We emphasize flexible engagement rather than mandated participation levels. People's capacity fluctuates; our structures should accommodate that reality rather than demanding constant availability.

## What You'll Gain

Participants gain experience in:
- Event planning and facilitation
- Community organizing and mutual aid practices
- Non-hierarchical decision-making processes
- Research-creation methodology and practice
- Connection with like-minded collaborators across disciplines

More importantly, you'll be part of building something: collective infrastructure for creative researchers that institutions don't provide.

## How to Get Involved

If you're a masters student, doctoral candidate, artist, or community ally interested in joining our work, we'd love to hear from you. You can:

- [Start a discussion](https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/discussions) introducing yourself
- Attend an upcoming SORCE event
- Reach out through our contact channels

We're particularly interested in hearing from people whose identities and experiences are underrepresented in academic spaces. Building collective infrastructure means building it with everyone who needs it.
