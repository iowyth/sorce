SORCE Collective is proud to present the **Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Conference** — an experimental event combining art-making with conversation, structured around spatial-temporal dimensions.

## Rethinking the Conference

Traditional academic conferences follow predictable formats: keynotes, parallel panels, Q&A sessions. The Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Conference asks: what if we organized knowledge exchange differently?

## The Format

Instead of linear programming, participants navigate through interconnected sessions based on their interests and curiosity. The conference is structured around:

- **Spatial dimensions**: Different rooms/spaces hosting different modes of engagement
- **Temporal dimensions**: Sessions that overlap, allowing for movement and choice
- **Art-making**: Creative practice integrated throughout, not separated into "arts programming"

## Key Features

### Non-linear Navigation
Participants chart their own path through the conference, following threads of interest rather than predetermined schedules.

### Integrated Practice
Making is part of thinking. Sessions include hands-on creative elements alongside discussion.

### Emergent Connections
The structure encourages unexpected encounters and interdisciplinary exchange.

## Outcomes

Rather than proceedings or papers, the conference generates:
- Collaborative artworks
- New connections and future collaborations
- Shared documentation and reflection
