SORCE Collective hosted an interactive event called "The Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-Conference" on Saturday, June 29th, 2024, at the Daphne Coxwell Complex (288 Church St., 7th floor).

The event structure combined artistic creation with meaningful dialogue. Participants explored four conceptual dimensions—the point, the line, the space, and the time—through self-directed paths. The day began with an extended land acknowledgment recognizing all living beings past, present, and future in that location. A bell signaled transitions between sections, allowing attendees to regroup and share discoveries.

The organizers emphasized gathering and knowledge-sharing "while having fun, making art, and talking about our experiences."

## Poet's Reflection

Kyra Min Poole reflected on lingering thoughts about circularity and universality from the weekend. She described unexpected observations during train travel and upon returning home, where wildflowers welcomed the group back. Poole expressed gratitude for land's support and contemplated organic connections occupying space.

She appreciated the "artful thought exercise" that catalyzed both immediate and delayed experiences. Rather than structured questions, conversations naturally centered on research interests and creative outputs. Poole documented her artistic journey through drawings of imaginative subjects.
