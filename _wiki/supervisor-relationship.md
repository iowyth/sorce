Your supervisor is your main point of contact for your graduate studies. This is also the relationship you might encounter the most difficulties with, and where the power dynamics are the most imbalanced.

## Official Roles of the Supervisory Committee

The official roles of the supervisory committee are listed as:

- Reviewing your research proposal
- Deciding to recommend your proposal to the Program Director (chair)
- Reviewing your progress from time to time
- If you don't do your work, then they can get you suspended
- They send your dissertation to your committee (no later than five weeks prior to the date set for your oral exam)
- They recommend your thesis to the Program Director (chair)

All activities outside of these official duties, including meeting frequency, communication style, etc. is to be communicated between Supervisor and Supervisee.

## Finding a Supervisor and Committee

If you are completely at a loss of who might fit with your research, the [York program website](https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/communication-and-culture/) has a search option for the faculty that can be very helpful.

### Considerations When Locating an Appropriate Supervisor

- What kind of support do you need? Hands off or hands on?
- How often do you/they want to meet?
- What other forms of help can they offer (e.g. essay feedback, career guidance, logistical support for conference presentations, etc.)
- What is their approach to mentorship?
- What are their expectations of you? (e.g. publications, conferences, working groups, etc.)
- What is your timeline for graduation and how does this meet with their expectations?

Committee members may be available for informal support or may only be involved in official examinations. You have to navigate your expectations with their availability, but you can usually access more support by thinking through and communicating your needs.

## Introducing Yourself

You need to write an email to introduce yourself to interesting looking professors, or to follow-up with in-person introductions. Full, Associate, and Emeritus professors can supervise graduate students. What works for a good intro will depend on the professor. It is generally good to write a short, concise email that details your research interest and some possible intersections with their work. Including a one-pager about your research can't hurt. It might let them get a better idea of what you are doing.

When you meet with a potential supervisor or committee member, think about it as a mutual interview. You will need to trust this person and spend a lot of time receiving feedback from them, so you may want to ensure that they feel safe, generous, open to feedback, and willing to bend rules when necessary.

## Changing Supervisor and Committee Members

It is okay and normal to change your supervisor and committee members over time. Some students have a completely different committee for their comps than their dissertation. Also it is normal for a new committee member to step in toward the writing phase of your dissertation as this phase is where you are starting to understand your path, therefore if you need someone new who aligns with your growth feel free to replace a committee member with one who fits you more closely.

To change these roles you should first have a conversation with your supervisor about these changes. A supportive supervisor will not challenge you on this, but will support you in locating appropriate supports.

On both the York and TMU sides, you must fill out a Supervisory Form. The new committee member and the previous committee member will both need to sign the form. Also the graduate program director will need to sign the form. You can ask them to sign it directly or ask your supervisor to sign the form. Once this form is completed you send this to the GPA. The GPA will file this and ask you to submit the changes in the SSC portal. Once you fill out the information in the portal be sure to press submit/complete. Once you press complete the GPA will be able to see the changes on their end.

**Do not feel alarmed or strange for changing these roles. This is a normal process to change supervisor and committee members! If you need the change, do what is best for you! Some grad students have had up to 4 different supervisors. That is okay.**

## Annual Progress Review

In accordance with Senate Policy 170b, every student in a degree program is required to submit one Progress Report per year, normally at the end of the winter term in the form and format set out by YSGS. Annual Progress Reviews are used to provide feedback, support, and evaluation of your research progress during the past 12 months. Once submitted, your comments will be shared with your supervisor and the program director.

This review builds a documentary record that stages a strategic narrative about your progress through the program. This matters because if anything goes sideways (i.e. if your progress stalls, you have to take a leave of absence, or your supervisor is struck dead by a runaway ox-cart) these annual reports establish a context for how your case would be handled in relation to your trajectory through the program. Writing a fact-based narrative that frames your scholarship in a particular way relative to the normative institutional expectations will help to establish evidence of this trajectory.
