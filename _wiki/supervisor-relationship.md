## Finding a Supervisor

Finding a supervisor is one of the most important decisions you will make in your graduate career. Your supervisor will guide your research, provide feedback on your work, and advocate for you within the program and beyond.

### Before You Approach Someone

- Research faculty members whose work aligns with your interests
- Read their publications
- Attend their talks or lectures if possible
- Ask current students about their experiences

### Making Contact

When reaching out to a potential supervisor:

- Be clear about your research interests
- Explain why you think they would be a good fit
- Ask if they are taking on new students
- Request a meeting to discuss further

### Questions to Ask Potential Supervisors

- What is your supervision style?
- How often do you typically meet with students?
- What are your expectations for student progress?
- How do you prefer to give feedback?
- What is your current workload like?
- Do you have funding available for students?

## Working with Your Supervisor

### Communication

Clear, regular communication is essential. Establish early on:

- **Meeting frequency**: Weekly, bi-weekly, monthly?
- **Meeting format**: In-person, video call, email updates?
- **Feedback preferences**: Track changes, verbal feedback, written comments?
- **Response times**: How quickly can you expect replies?

### Managing Expectations

Be honest about:
- Your progress and any challenges
- Your timeline and commitments
- Your needs for support or guidance

### When Things Get Difficult

Supervisory relationships can be challenging. If you're experiencing difficulties:

- Try to address concerns directly with your supervisor first
- Seek advice from other faculty members you trust
- Contact the Graduate Program Director
- Reach out to the graduate student association
- Know that changing supervisors, while difficult, is sometimes necessary

## Changing Supervisors

Sometimes a supervisory relationship doesn't work out. This is more common than you might think. If you need to change supervisors:

- Reflect on what isn't working and what you need
- Speak with the Graduate Program Director
- Approach potential new supervisors carefully
- Be professional in your transition
- Know that this decision is about your success
