Your supervisor is your main point of contact for your graduate studies. This is also the relationship you might encounter the most difficulties with, and where the power dynamics are the most imbalanced. Below are some things to consider when looking for a supervisor, as well as for the relationship itself.

## Why Does This Relationship Matter?

- Your supervisor is your main advocate in the program
- They provide guidance on your research direction
- They sign off on your major milestones
- They write reference letters for jobs and further study
- The relationship can significantly impact your wellbeing

## Looking for a Supervisor

We hope that you found a supervisor before you started your program. At the same time, it may be the case that you are looking for a new supervisor, either because yours has become unavailable (sabbatical, departure, conflict) or because you haven't found one yet. When looking for a supervisor there are many things to consider.

### Questions to Ask Yourself

- What are you working on?
- What supervision style matches your work style?
- Do you want a supervisor who is hands-on or hands-off?
- How often do you want to meet?
- Do you want someone in your specific field or adjacent?

### Questions to Ask Potential Supervisors

- What is your supervision style?
- How often do you typically meet with students?
- What are your expectations for student progress?
- How do you prefer to give feedback?
- What is your current workload like?
- Are you planning any sabbaticals or leaves?

### Questions to Ask Their Students

One of the best ways to learn about a potential supervisor is to ask their current or former students:

- What is it like to work with them?
- How responsive are they?
- What are meetings like?
- Would you recommend them?

## Maintaining the Relationship

### Communication

Clear, regular communication is essential. Establish early on:

- **Meeting frequency**: Weekly, bi-weekly, monthly?
- **Meeting format**: In-person, video call, email updates?
- **Feedback preferences**: Track changes, verbal feedback, written comments?
- **Response times**: How quickly can you expect replies?

### Managing Expectations

Be honest with your supervisor about:

- Your progress and any challenges
- Your timeline and external commitments
- Your needs for support or guidance
- When things aren't working

### When Things Get Difficult

Supervisory relationships can be challenging. If you're experiencing difficulties:

- Try to address concerns directly with your supervisor first
- Seek advice from other faculty members you trust
- Contact the Graduate Program Director
- Reach out to the graduate student association
- Know that changing supervisors, while difficult, is sometimes necessary and more common than you think

## Changing Supervisors

Sometimes a supervisory relationship doesn't work out. This is more common than you might think, and it is not a reflection of your worth as a student.

If you need to change supervisors:

- Reflect on what isn't working and what you need differently
- Speak with the Graduate Program Director
- Approach potential new supervisors carefully
- Be professional in your transition
- Know that this decision is about your success
