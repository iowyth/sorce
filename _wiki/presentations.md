### Research Talks

Presenting to your department, a research group, or at a job talk.

### Three Minute Thesis (3MT)

### Poster Sessions

Presenting your research visually on a poster, discussing with attendees who stop by.

## Preparing Your Presentation

### Structure

A typical conference presentation:

1. **Introduction** - Hook, context, research question
2. **Background** - Brief literature/theory
3. **Methods** - How you did the research
4. **Findings** - What you found
5. **Discussion** - What it means
6. **Conclusion** - Key takeaways

### Slides

If using slides:

- Keep text minimal
- Use images and visuals effectively
- Make sure text is readable from the back of the room
- Don't read your slides verbatim
- Have a backup plan if technology fails

### Timing

- Practice with a timer
- Build in buffer time
- Know what to cut if running long
- Respect time limits

### Notes

- Find a system that works for you
- Full script, bullet points, or minimal notes
- Practice enough that you're not reading
- Have your notes accessible but not distracting

## Delivering Your Presentation

### Managing Nerves

- Practice, practice, practice
- Breathe
- Remember: the audience wants you to succeed
- It's okay to pause and collect your thoughts
- A little nervousness is normal and can be energizing

### Engaging Your Audience

- Make eye contact (or look at foreheads)
- Vary your tone and pace
- Use gestures naturally
- Check in with the audience
- Be enthusiastic about your work

### Handling Questions

- Listen to the full question
- It's okay to ask for clarification
- Don't be defensive
- "That's a great question for future research" is a valid response
- If you don't know, say so

## After the Presentation

- Collect contact information from interested attendees
- Follow up on any commitments you made
- Reflect on what went well and what to improve
- Save your materials for future use
