Giving presentations is a core part of academic life. Whether at conferences, in classes, or for job talks, you'll present your work many times throughout your graduate career.

## Types of Presentations

### Conference Papers

The most common format: 15-20 minutes to present your research, followed by questions from the panel and audience.

### Guest Lectures

Invited to speak in a class or seminar, usually 45-90 minutes with discussion.

### Research Talks

Presenting to your department, a research group, or as part of a job application. Length varies, but often 20-45 minutes plus questions.

### Three Minute Thesis (3MT)

A competition format where you present your entire research project in exactly three minutes with one static slide. Great practice for explaining your work to non-specialists.

### Poster Sessions

Presenting your research visually on a poster and discussing with attendees who stop by. More conversational than a formal paper.

## Preparing Your Presentation

### Structure

A typical conference presentation follows this structure:

1. **Introduction**: Hook your audience, provide context, state your research question
2. **Background**: Brief literature review or theoretical framework (just the essentials)
3. **Methods**: How you approached the research (if applicable)
4. **Findings/Analysis**: What you found or what you're arguing
5. **Discussion**: What it means, why it matters
6. **Conclusion**: Key takeaways, next steps, invitation for questions

### Slides

If using slides (you don't have to):

- Keep text minimal — slides support your talk, they don't replace it
- Use images, diagrams, and visuals effectively
- Make sure text is readable from the back of the room (big fonts!)
- Don't read your slides verbatim
- Have a backup plan if technology fails (bring a USB, email yourself the file, have notes)

### Timing

- Practice with a timer, multiple times
- Build in buffer time — you'll likely talk faster due to nerves, or slower if you ad lib
- Know what you can cut if you're running long
- Respect time limits — going over is disrespectful to other presenters and the audience

### Notes

Find a system that works for you:

- Full script (but don't just read it)
- Detailed bullet points
- Minimal cue cards
- Notes view on your slides

Practice enough that you can look up from your notes and engage with the audience.

## Delivering Your Presentation

### Managing Nerves

Everyone gets nervous. Some strategies:

- Practice, practice, practice — familiarity reduces anxiety
- Breathe deeply before you start
- Remember: the audience wants you to succeed
- It's okay to pause and collect your thoughts
- A little nervousness can be energizing — channel it

### Engaging Your Audience

- Make eye contact (or look at foreheads if direct eye contact is hard)
- Vary your tone and pace — monotone puts people to sleep
- Use gestures naturally
- Check in with the audience: "Does that make sense?" "Any questions on this before I move on?"
- Show enthusiasm for your work — it's contagious

### Handling Questions

- Listen to the full question before responding
- It's okay to ask for clarification ("Could you say more about what you mean by...?")
- Don't be defensive — questions are engagement, not attacks
- "That's a great question for future research" is a valid response
- If you don't know the answer, say so: "I'm not sure, but I'd be happy to think about that more and follow up"
- Keep answers concise — you don't need to give another presentation

## After the Presentation

- Collect contact information from interested attendees
- Follow up on any commitments you made ("I'll send you that reference")
- Reflect on what went well and what you'd do differently
- Save your slides and notes for future use
- Revise your paper based on feedback and questions you received
