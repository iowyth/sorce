## Writing the Dissertation

The dissertation is the culminating project of your PhD. It is an original contribution to knowledge in your field, typically 200-400 pages in length.

### Structure

Dissertations vary in structure depending on field and methodology. Common formats include:

**Traditional Format**
- Introduction
- Literature Review
- Methodology
- Findings/Analysis (multiple chapters)
- Conclusion

**Article-Based Format**
- Introduction
- 3-4 publishable articles
- Conclusion

Discuss format options with your supervisor and committee.

### Writing Process

There is no single right way to write a dissertation. Some strategies that work for students:

- **Write regularly**: Daily or weekly writing habits help maintain momentum
- **Don't write linearly**: Many students write the introduction last
- **Set small goals**: A page a day, a section a week
- **Get feedback early**: Share drafts with your supervisor as you go
- **Join a writing group**: Accountability and community help
- **Protect your writing time**: Treat it like a non-negotiable appointment

### Common Challenges

- Perfectionism and procrastination
- Isolation and loneliness
- Imposter syndrome
- Balancing writing with other responsibilities
- Knowing when "done" is done

You are not alone in facing these challenges. Reach out to peers, your supervisor, and support services when needed.

## The Defense

### Scheduling

Work with your supervisor and Graduate Program Director to schedule your defense. You will need to:

- Submit your dissertation to your committee with adequate notice (usually 4-6 weeks)
- Coordinate schedules for all committee members
- Book a room for the defense
- Handle any administrative requirements

### The Defense Format

A typical defense includes:

1. **Opening presentation** (20-30 minutes): Present your research
2. **Committee questions** (1-2 hours): Respond to questions from committee members
3. **Public questions** (if applicable): Respond to questions from audience
4. **Deliberation**: Committee discusses in private
5. **Result**: Committee announces their decision

### Preparing for the Defense

- Know your dissertation thoroughly
- Anticipate likely questions
- Practice your presentation
- Prepare for big-picture and specific questions
- Get enough sleep the night before
- Remember: you are the expert on your own work

### Outcomes

- Pass
- Pass with minor revisions
- Pass with major revisions
- Revise and resubmit

The vast majority of students who reach the defense stage pass. Your committee would not let you defend if they didn't believe you were ready.

## After the Defense

### Revisions

Most students have some revisions to complete. Work with your supervisor to address committee feedback and submit your final version.

### Submission

Submit your final dissertation to the Faculty of Graduate Studies. Follow all formatting and submission guidelines carefully.

### Celebration

You did it! Take time to celebrate this major accomplishment.
