A dissertation follows a recognizable format: if it looks and functions like a dissertation, it will likely be accepted as such. The key is ensuring it meets enough of the standard elements to be defensible. Departments and supervisors may vary in their openness to experimental methods or unconventional structures, so proposing an unorthodox format depends on how supportive and flexible your academic environment is.

At its core, the dissertation is a long-form argument aimed at a specific audience, including your supervisor, committee members, examiners, department chairs, and the broader academic discipline you're engaging with. The success of this argument requires both intellectual exploration and social navigation, as the research process is shaped by departmental dynamics and interpersonal relationships.

Those involved in evaluating your work impose both explicit and implicit boundaries on what is considered "appropriate" and "rigorous." These standards are flexible and influenced by biases, including those rooted in white supremacy and colonialism, which can marginalise non-traditional or Indigenous forms of knowledge. Consequently, some valuable knowledge may be excluded, while other forms that align with established norms may not be truly ethical or appropriate. The quality and integrity of the knowledge produced are, therefore, shaped by the people and systems involved in the process.

## Constructing Your Argument

To construct a persuasive argument, it helps to think of it as a story. Even in positivist frameworks, where factual mechanisms are central, the narrative needs to explain how these facts intersect with existing knowledge to make the material comprehensible. Knowing your audience—those engaged with similar questions—guides the depth and focus of your explanation.

The way you communicate your findings should adapt to the context of the discussion and the people involved. Rather than limiting the scope of the study, this relational approach allows complex ideas to be conveyed simply, while broader theoretical insights can be made applicable through focused, case-specific examples. Framing your argument as a discussion opens space for broad intellectual exploration, which can then be strategically narrowed to fit the contextual needs of your field.
