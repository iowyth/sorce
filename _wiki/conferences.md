Conferences are gatherings where scholars present their research, learn about new work, and network with others in their field. They're an important part of academic life and professional development.

## Why Attend Conferences?

- Share your research and get feedback from others in your field
- Learn about new and emerging scholarship
- Meet other scholars and build your professional network
- Discover job and collaboration opportunities
- Put faces to the names you've been reading
- Travel and experience new places (a nice perk!)

## Finding Conferences

### Conferences Relevant to ComCult

Some major conferences where ComCult students present:

- **Canadian Communication Association (CCA)** — Annual conference, held at Congress
- **International Communication Association (ICA)** — Large international conference
- **National Communication Association (NCA)** — US-based, large and broad
- **Cultural Studies Association (CSA)** — Interdisciplinary cultural studies
- **Society for Cinema and Media Studies (SCMS)** — Film and media studies
- **Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR)** — Internet and digital culture
- **Console-ing Passions** — Television and media, feminist approaches

### Other Opportunities

- **Graduate student conferences**: Lower pressure, great for practice, and good networking with peers
- **Regional and local conferences**: Easier to attend, often free or cheap
- **Specialized conferences**: Smaller gatherings focused on your specific area
- **Interdisciplinary conferences**: Good for broadening your perspective

## Types of Presentations

### Poster Presentations

Poster presentations involve creating a visual display of your research that you present in a dedicated session. Attendees walk around viewing posters and speaking with presenters. These are often seen as more casual but can be great for in-depth one-on-one conversations about your work.

### Conference Papers

Conference papers are written documents that you may read or present from. Some conferences require submission of a full paper before or after the conference. The paper format allows for more detailed argumentation than a presentation alone.

### Conference Presentations

Oral presentations are typically 15-20 minutes where you share your research with an audience, followed by Q&A. This is the most common conference format.

## Fording Difficult Questions

Questions after presentations can be nerve-wracking. Some tips:

- It's okay to take a moment to think before answering
- If you don't know the answer, say so honestly and offer to follow up
- "That's a great question that I'm still thinking through" is a valid response
- Redirect to what you do know if a question is outside your scope
- Hostile questions are rare, but if they happen, stay calm and professional
- You can say "I'd love to discuss this more after the session"

## After Hours Networking

A lot of conference networking happens outside of formal sessions — at receptions, dinners, and informal gatherings. This can be challenging for introverts or those uncomfortable in social situations.

- You don't have to attend everything
- Find one or two people to talk to rather than working the whole room
- It's okay to leave early if you're exhausted
- Coffee breaks and meals are lower-pressure networking opportunities
- Following up after the conference is just as valuable as connecting in person

## Funding

Conferences can be expensive (registration, travel, accommodation, food). Look for funding from:

- Your supervisor's research grants (ask!)
- Graduate program travel funds
- Graduate student associations (YUGSA, GSU)
- Faculty of Graduate Studies travel awards
- External grants (SSHRC provides some conference funding)
- Conference bursaries and fee waivers (many conferences offer these)

**Apply early** — many funding sources have limited pools and deadlines well before the conference.

## Self-Care at Conferences

Conferences can be exhausting, especially for introverts or those with social anxiety.

- Take breaks when you need them
- You don't have to attend every session
- Eat and stay hydrated
- Get enough sleep
- Find quiet spaces when you need to recharge
- It's okay to skip the reception and go to bed
