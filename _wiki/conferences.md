Conferences are gatherings where scholars present their research, learn about new work, and network with others in their field. They're an important part of academic life and professional development.

## Why Attend Conferences?

- Share your research and get feedback from others in your field
- Learn about new and emerging scholarship
- Meet other scholars and build your professional network
- Discover job and collaboration opportunities
- Put faces to the names you've been reading
- Travel and experience new places (a nice perk!)

## Finding Conferences

### Conferences Relevant to ComCult

Some major conferences where ComCult students present:

- **Canadian Communication Association (CCA)** — Annual conference, held at Congress
- **International Communication Association (ICA)** — Large international conference
- **National Communication Association (NCA)** — US-based, large and broad
- **Cultural Studies Association (CSA)** — Interdisciplinary cultural studies
- **Society for Cinema and Media Studies (SCMS)** — Film and media studies
- **Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR)** — Internet and digital culture
- **Console-ing Passions** — Television and media, feminist approaches

### Other Opportunities

- **Graduate student conferences**: Lower pressure, great for practice, and good networking with peers
- **Regional and local conferences**: Easier to attend, often free or cheap
- **Specialized conferences**: Smaller gatherings focused on your specific area
- **Interdisciplinary conferences**: Good for broadening your perspective

## The Submission Process

### Finding Calls for Papers (CFPs)

- Sign up for mailing lists in your field
- Follow organizations and scholars on social media
- Check [H-Net](https://networks.h-net.org/), [UPenn CFP list](https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/), and discipline-specific lists
- Ask your supervisor and colleagues what conferences they recommend

### Writing Abstracts

Most conferences require abstract submissions (usually 150-500 words). A strong abstract:

- Clearly states your argument or research question
- Indicates your methodology or approach
- Suggests your contribution to the field or conversation
- Is well-written, specific, and error-free
- Matches the conference theme (if there is one)

### Panels

Some conferences accept panel proposals (3-4 presenters on a common theme). Panels can be:

- **Pre-constituted**: You organize the panel and submit it together
- **Formed by organizers**: Individual submissions grouped by theme

Organizing a panel can increase your chances of acceptance and lets you shape the conversation.

## Funding

Conferences can be expensive (registration, travel, accommodation, food). Look for funding from:

- Your supervisor's research grants (ask!)
- Graduate program travel funds
- Graduate student associations (YUGSA, GSU)
- Faculty of Graduate Studies travel awards
- External grants (SSHRC provides some conference funding)
- Conference bursaries and fee waivers (many conferences offer these)

**Apply early** — many funding sources have limited pools and deadlines well before the conference.

## At the Conference

### Presenting Your Work

- Practice your presentation multiple times before the conference
- Time yourself (most presentations are 15-20 minutes; respect the limit)
- Prepare for questions
- Bring notes, but don't just read them
- Have backup plans for technology failures

### Networking

- Attend panels beyond your own area — you might discover new connections
- Go to receptions and social events (this is where a lot of networking happens)
- Introduce yourself to scholars whose work you admire (they're usually happy to meet you!)
- Exchange contact information (or just find them on social media later)
- Follow up after the conference with people you connected with

### Self-Care at Conferences

Conferences can be exhausting, especially for introverts or those with social anxiety.

- Take breaks when you need them
- You don't have to attend every session
- Eat and stay hydrated
- Get enough sleep
- Find quiet spaces when you need to recharge
- It's okay to skip the reception and go to bed

## After the Conference

- Follow up with people you met
- Revise your paper based on feedback you received
- Consider submitting to journals or other publications
- Reflect on what you learned and what you'd do differently
