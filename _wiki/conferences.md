## Why Attend Conferences?

Conferences are an important part of academic life. They allow you to:

- Share your research and get feedback
- Learn about new work in your field
- Meet other scholars and build networks
- Discover job and collaboration opportunities
- Travel and see new places

## Finding Conferences

### In Communication and Culture

Some conferences relevant to ComCult students:

- Canadian Communication Association (CCA)
- International Communication Association (ICA)
- National Communication Association (NCA)
- Cultural Studies Association (CSA)
- Society for Cinema and Media Studies (SCMS)
- Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR)

### Beyond the Big Ones

- Graduate student conferences (lower pressure, good practice)
- Regional and local conferences
- Specialized conferences in your specific area
- Interdisciplinary conferences

## The Submission Process

### Calls for Papers (CFPs)

- Watch for CFPs in your areas of interest
- Sign up for mailing lists and follow organizations on social media
- Check [H-Net](https://networks.h-net.org/), [UPenn CFP](https://call-for-papers.sas.upenn.edu/), and discipline-specific lists

### Abstracts

Most conferences require abstract submissions (150-500 words). A strong abstract:

- Clearly states your argument or research question
- Indicates your methodology or approach
- Suggests your contribution to the field
- Is well-written and error-free

### Panels

Some conferences accept panel proposals (3-4 presenters on a theme). Panels can be:

- Pre-constituted (you organize the panel)
- Formed by organizers from individual submissions

## Funding

Conferences can be expensive. Look for funding from:

- Your supervisor's research grants
- Graduate program travel funds
- Graduate student associations
- External grants (SSHRC, etc.)
- Conference bursaries and waivers

Apply early - many funding sources have limited pools.

## At the Conference

### Presenting

- Practice your presentation
- Time yourself (most presentations are 15-20 minutes)
- Prepare for questions
- Bring notes but don't just read them

### Networking

- Attend panels beyond your own area
- Go to receptions and social events
- Introduce yourself to scholars whose work you admire
- Exchange contact information
- Follow up after the conference

### Self-Care

Conferences can be exhausting. Remember to:

- Take breaks when needed
- Eat and stay hydrated
- Get enough sleep
- It's okay to skip sessions if you need to
