Comprehensive examinations (comps) are a major milestone in the PhD program. They demonstrate your mastery of your field and readiness to conduct independent dissertation research.

## What Are Comps?

Comps are an examination process where you demonstrate comprehensive knowledge of:

- Your specific research area
- Relevant theoretical frameworks
- Methodological approaches
- Key debates and conversations in your field

Comps typically occur after coursework is complete, usually in Year 2 or early Year 3 of the PhD.

## Format

The format of comprehensive exams in ComCult is quite flexible and is determined in consultation with your committee. Common formats include:

### Written Component

- **Timed exams**: Written responses to questions over a set period (e.g., 3 hours, 1 day)
- **Take-home essays**: Extended papers written over several days or weeks
- **Field statements**: Longer papers (20-40 pages) on designated topic areas

### Oral Component

- Discussion with your committee members
- Defense of your written work
- Exploration of your field, methodology, and research direction
- Usually 1-2 hours

### Typical Structure

Many students complete:
- 2-3 written field statements or exams
- Followed by an oral examination/defense

Your committee will help you determine the format that works best for your research.

## Preparing for Comps

### Reading Lists

Work with your supervisor and committee to develop reading lists. The lists typically include:

- Core texts in your field(s)
- Key methodological works
- Major theoretical frameworks
- Important debates and turning points
- Recent interventions and where the field is heading

Expect to read 50-100+ texts across your lists, depending on your committee's expectations.

### Timeline

Start preparing well in advance:

- **6-12 months before**: Begin developing reading lists with your committee
- **3-6 months before**: Intensive reading and note-taking period
- **1-3 months before**: Synthesizing, reviewing, and identifying connections
- **Final weeks**: Practice writing/speaking and self-care

### Study Strategies

- Create reading notes, summaries, and annotated bibliographies
- Form study groups with other students doing comps
- Practice writing under timed conditions
- Meet with committee members to discuss readings
- Take care of your physical and mental health during this intense period
- Remember that you're not expected to memorize everything — you're learning to think like a scholar

## The Examination

### Written Component

- Read questions carefully before you start
- Manage your time — don't spend too long on one question
- Draw on your reading broadly; show your range
- Make arguments, don't just summarize readings
- Cite specific sources to support your points
- It's okay to not know everything — demonstrate your thinking process

### Oral Component

- It's okay to take a moment to think before answering
- Engage with questions as intellectual exploration, not defense
- Admit when you don't know something — say what you do know
- Ask for clarification if you don't understand a question
- Treat it as a scholarly conversation with colleagues

## After Comps

### Possible Outcomes

- **Pass**: Congratulations! Move forward to dissertation proposal
- **Pass with minor revisions**: Small revisions required, then proceed
- **Conditional pass**: More substantial work needed before proceeding
- **Fail**: Opportunity to retake (rare, and usually with significant support)

Most students pass, often with minor revisions. The goal is for you to succeed.

### Moving Forward

After passing comps, you move on to your dissertation proposal. The intellectual work you did for comps — the reading, the synthesis, the argumentation — forms the foundation for your proposal and dissertation.
