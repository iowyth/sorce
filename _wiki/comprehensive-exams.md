## What Are Comprehensive Exams?

Comprehensive exams (comps) are a major milestone in the PhD program. They demonstrate your mastery of your field and readiness to conduct independent research. Comps typically occur after coursework is complete, usually in Year 2 or early Year 3.

## Format

The format of comprehensive exams varies by student and committee. Common formats include:

### Written Exams
- Timed written responses to questions
- Take-home essays over several days
- Extended papers on designated topics

### Oral Exams
- Discussion with committee members
- Defense of written work
- Exploration of your field and methodology

### Combination
Many students complete both written and oral components.

## Preparing for Comps

### Reading Lists

Work with your supervisor and committee to develop reading lists. These typically include:

- Core texts in your field
- Methodological works
- Theoretical frameworks
- Key debates and conversations

### Timeline

Start preparing early:

- **6-12 months before**: Begin developing reading lists with committee
- **3-6 months before**: Intensive reading period
- **1-3 months before**: Synthesizing and reviewing
- **Final weeks**: Practice and preparation

### Study Strategies

- Create reading notes and summaries
- Form study groups with other students
- Practice writing under timed conditions
- Meet with committee members to discuss readings
- Take care of your health during this intense period

## During the Exam

### Written Component

- Read questions carefully
- Manage your time
- Draw on your reading broadly
- Make arguments, don't just summarize
- Cite specific sources

### Oral Component

- It's okay to take a moment to think
- Engage with questions, don't just defend
- Admit when you don't know something
- Treat it as a scholarly conversation

## After Comps

### Possible Outcomes

- Pass
- Pass with revisions
- Conditional pass
- Fail (with option to retake)

Most students pass, often with minor revisions. If you don't pass the first time, you will have the opportunity to try again.

### Moving Forward

After passing comps, you move on to your dissertation proposal. The work you did for comps forms the foundation for your proposal and dissertation.
