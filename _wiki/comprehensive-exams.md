The historical genesis of the comprehensive exams is the reproduction of cultural capital. The explicit goal is for the candidate to demonstrate "mastery" of certain fields within their "discipline." Obviously that's a very patriarchal and colonial way of framing knowledge: knowledge is mastery of the world, and expertise is the mastery of knowledge; being an expert qualifies you to be master over other, lesser, knowers.

In practice, the social sciences and especially the humanities see the notion of 'mastery' as obsolete at best, if only for the simple reason that disciplinary boundaries as clearly constituted fields are a thing of the past, especially for interdisciplinary work. Most scholars treat the comprehensives as an opportunity for the candidate to build their careers by doing concentrated work that can inform their dissertation and/or their future teaching.

The difficulty of comprehensive exams can be built up by students and faculty alike due to their extended, isolating, and difficult nature. The most dangerous game, is man! This does not need to be as difficult as people let on. It's possible to use strategies to make the best use of your time and reduce the difficulty of the process.

## Choosing Your Sections

Choosing your topics can require a bit of soul searching. This can mean connecting with yourself around what problems and opportunities engage you. What are you fascinated by that you would feel good to teach others? You might consider what social needs are most urgent, as a means of being the change you want to see in the world.

You are asked to choose three topics: 1) the major general, 2) the major specific, 3) the minor general. A number of different approaches to choosing these topics suit different kinds of projects.

**For those building a specialty:** This is essentially choosing your teaching and research area. You approach topics as:
1. The broad area of research (e.g., cultural studies)
2. The specific part of that broad area (e.g., television media)
3. A very narrow aspect of that (e.g., queer representation in television)

**For more nomadic scholars:** You can make use of your reading to create an interdisciplinary specialty with a mind to double-purpose your comprehensive readings with the knowledge required to write a thesis:
1. A major concept, question, or issue of interest (e.g., healing fractures between self/environment)
2. An aspect of that concept (e.g., embodied action as praxis)
3. A specific quality or aspect of this (e.g., mad liberation)

## Tips for Assembling Your Literature

- Download syllabi from the internet (from university or faculty pages)
- AI systems can be helpful to quickly assess the major thinkers in a field of study, but sources supplied by AI require independent validation
- The reference lists of highly relevant or exciting works can be especially fruitful
- Speaking to library staff can help. Staff may not be knowledgeable about the topic of your study, so go into these meetings with some prepared questions and research issues
- Speaking to your supervisor and committee members for ideas
- Reaching out beyond your committee is also possible when your committee is not knowledgeable on your specific topic. Consider scheduling informative interviews with faculty with an interesting area of study, to pick their brains on what important works you should be aware of
- Networking with other students and reading their comprehensive lists can give you insight into how others are approaching the task
- Program administrators will also share past comprehensive lists, if asked

### AI Prompts

Try: "Can you give me a survey of the major thinkers in (subject area), including their major theoretical focus, including a historical breakdown of different movements within this discipline, complete with an overview of critiques to this discipline and method, including responses to these critiques?"

## Choosing Your Questions

You need to choose three questions for each section of your Comprehensive Exams. These will be the essay questions that you answer in your exam and are developed in collaboration with your supervisor and committee members, agreed upon, and then submitted to the chair for approval along with your comprehensive lists.

As you will only need to answer one of the three questions for each section, many candidates choose to "pre-write" two of their questions, leaving the third to fly in the wind. Two questions are selected by the committee, with the candidate then left to choose one of these. Pre-writing two papers enables efficient preparation for the exam.

Of course, the traditional test gives you two days, only 24 hours for each section. In the 48hr option, you are expected to write 2 papers - both majors, and then you can take a break and have another 24 for your minor.

Committees will often select those questions that appear to be invested with specificity. This suggests that the candidate is prepared to answer that question. In this way, you might consider your questions to be thesis statements to a short paper drawing from your comprehensive materials, but not necessarily all materials.

**Considerations when crafting your questions (to avoid busy-work):**
- Could your question be repurposed to act as a section of your dissertation?
- Could the question help to background your dissertation?
- Is your question grounded, enabling you to selectively read your texts?

## Writing Your Comps Papers

**Formal Writing Process:** Students will normally receive the questions around 10 am, and will be required to hand in their answers before noon two days later (Major) or one day later (Minor), or three days later for the 72-hour option. Answers for each part should range from about 3500 to 4000 words, or about 10 to 12 double-spaced, typed pages, plus a list of works cited.

These papers are not exams in the traditional sense, but are meant to demonstrate your competency in your chosen subject matter as well as your ability to make a contribution as a scholar. You are encouraged to do more than simply regurgitate what they say. This is your chance to demonstrate your perspective on the materials you have read. These papers are your official contribution as a scholar, demonstrating your potential to expand your field of inquiry.

## The Oral Exam

For many, the oral exam is a semi-formal conversation about your comprehensive essays, with a mind to explore those essays as well as your future scholarship. Regressive methods of engaging in the oral exam may cause faculty to introduce tricky questions or ask you to refer to papers that you did not speak about extensively in your papers. This can be stressful if it happens, but if you are prepared, you can also defend your choice to skip papers that did not end up offering substantial insight into your topic.

## Essential Workarounds, Deadlines, and Exceptions

The amount of texts included in your comprehensive exams can range from between 12-15 per section, or even up to 30 texts (for those who love the struggle). The length of your comprehensive readings also varies between disciplines and will be affected by the number of books vs papers included in your lists. Generally, it is said that more than 5 books per section is too many, but you are the arbiter of your own misery in this case.

In total, students often take 6 months to generate their lists and 6 months to finish their readings. It is also known to take 1-2 years or more to finish this requirement if you have other life-circumstances going on, so try not to sweat it. You can prepare the dissertation proposal or even dissertation pieces during this process. There is nothing strictly barring you from working out of sequence.
