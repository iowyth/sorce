Your supervisory committee is the group of faculty members who guide your research, evaluate your progress at key milestones, and ultimately assess your dissertation.

## Committee Composition

### PhD Dissertation Committees

A typical PhD committee at ComCult includes:

- **Supervisor**: Your primary advisor (required)
- **2-3 Committee Members**: Additional faculty who provide expertise and perspective
- Committee members can be from York, TMU, or external institutions
- At least one member should be from each institution (York and TMU) — this is a program requirement

### MA Thesis/MRP Committees

For MA students, committees are typically smaller:

- **Supervisor**: Your primary advisor
- **Second Reader**: One additional faculty member (for thesis; optional for MRP)

## Choosing Committee Members

When selecting committee members, consider:

### Expertise and Fit

- Do they have knowledge relevant to your research area?
- Are they familiar with your methodology?
- Can they provide perspectives your supervisor might not?
- Will their expertise strengthen your work?

### Practical Considerations

- Do they have time to serve on your committee?
- Are they going on sabbatical during your program?
- Will they work well with your supervisor?
- Are they responsive to students?

### Career Development

- Can they help with your professional development?
- Do they have networks that might benefit you?
- Could they write reference letters for you?

## Approaching Potential Members

1. Discuss potential members with your supervisor first
2. Research their work and be prepared to explain why you want them
3. Send a clear email explaining your project and why you're reaching out
4. Be clear about expectations and your timeline
5. Give them an out if they're too busy — don't take it personally

## Working with Your Committee

### Meetings

- Schedule regular committee meetings (at least once per year for PhD)
- Prepare an agenda and materials in advance
- Send documents with enough lead time for review (2+ weeks)
- Take notes and follow up on action items
- Keep everyone informed of your progress between meetings

### Getting Feedback

- Be clear about what kind of feedback you need at each stage
- Give committee members enough time to review your work
- Be open to different perspectives — they're trying to help
- Remember that disagreement among committee members is normal
- You don't have to accept every piece of advice, but you should consider it

### Navigating Conflicts

Committee members may not always agree with each other. When this happens:

- Listen to all perspectives carefully
- Discuss the disagreement with your supervisor
- Ask clarifying questions
- Find common ground where possible
- Remember that you ultimately make the decisions about your work
- It's okay to explain your reasoning when you choose one direction over another
