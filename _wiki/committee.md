## What is a Committee?

Your committee is a group of faculty members who guide your research, evaluate your progress, and ultimately assess your dissertation. The committee typically includes:

- **Supervisor**: Your primary advisor
- **Committee Members**: Additional faculty who provide expertise and perspective
- **External Examiner**: For the final defense (added later)

## Committee Composition

### PhD Students

A typical PhD committee includes:
- 1 Supervisor
- 2-3 Committee Members
- Members can be from either York or TMU
- At least one member should be from each institution (recommended)

### MA Students

MRP committees are often smaller:
- 1 Supervisor
- 0-1 Second Reader

## Choosing Committee Members

When selecting committee members, consider:

- **Expertise**: Do they have knowledge relevant to your research?
- **Methodology**: Are they familiar with your methods?
- **Availability**: Do they have time to serve on your committee?
- **Working style**: Will they work well with you and your supervisor?
- **Career guidance**: Can they help with your professional development?

### Approaching Potential Members

- Discuss potential members with your supervisor first
- Research their work and be prepared to explain why you want them
- Be clear about expectations and timeline
- Give them an out if they're too busy

## Working with Your Committee

### Meetings

- Schedule regular committee meetings (at least once per year)
- Prepare materials in advance
- Send agendas and documents with enough lead time
- Take notes and follow up on action items

### Getting Feedback

- Be clear about what kind of feedback you need
- Give committee members enough time to review your work
- Be open to different perspectives
- Remember that disagreement among committee members is normal

### Navigating Conflicts

Committee members may not always agree. When this happens:

- Listen to all perspectives
- Discuss with your supervisor
- Find common ground where possible
- Remember that you ultimately make the decisions about your work
