Most graduate students work during their studies, either as part of their funding package or to supplement their income. This section covers types of employment available and tips for balancing work with your studies.

## Types of Graduate Employment

### Teaching Assistantships (TA)

TAs support undergraduate courses. Duties may include:

- Leading tutorials, seminars, or lab sections
- Grading assignments, papers, and exams
- Holding office hours
- Supporting the course instructor
- Occasionally guest lecturing

TA positions are often included in funding packages. They provide valuable teaching experience and look good on your CV.

### Research Assistantships (RA)

RAs support faculty research projects. Duties may include:

- Conducting literature reviews
- Collecting and analyzing data
- Transcribing interviews
- Editing and formatting manuscripts
- Managing research logistics

RA positions can connect directly to your own research interests and help you develop skills. Ask your supervisor if they have RA funding available.

### Graduate Assistantships (GA)

GAs work in various administrative and service roles:

- Program or departmental administration
- Student services offices
- Library and research services
- Communications and events

GA positions provide transferable skills and campus connections.

### Course Directorships (CD)

Advanced PhD students may have opportunities to design and teach their own courses as Course Directors. This is more work but excellent preparation for academic jobs.

## Finding Positions

### Internal Postings

- Check departmental emails and job boards regularly
- Faculty of Graduate Studies posts some positions
- Ask your supervisor about RA opportunities (they may not be posted)
- Network with other students who know about openings
- Express interest to professors whose work aligns with yours

### External Work

If seeking work outside the university:

- **International students**: Check your visa/study permit for work restrictions
- Consider how external work affects your program progress
- Look for work connected to your skills and interests
- Flexible or remote work can be easier to balance with studies

## Balancing Work and Study

Graduate employment supports your funding but competes for your time and energy.

### Tips for Balance

- Set boundaries on your work hours
- Communicate with supervisors (both academic and employment) about your capacity
- Remember that your degree is the priority — don't let work derail your research
- Track your hours carefully and don't work for free
- It's okay to say no to additional work

### Hour Limits

TA and RA positions have hour limits (e.g., 10 hours/week). These limits exist for a reason. If you're consistently working more than your contracted hours, that's a problem to address with your union or supervisor.

## Unions

Graduate employees are unionized at both institutions. **Know your rights as a worker.**

Your union can help with:
- Workplace issues and grievances
- Understanding your collective agreement
- Advocating for better working conditions
- Health and other benefits

### Toronto Metropolitan University

**CUPE 233** represents Teaching Assistants and other graduate employees.

### Why This Matters

Your union negotiated your wages, benefits, and working conditions. If you have problems at work — unpaid hours, harassment, unreasonable expectations — your union can help. Use these resources.
