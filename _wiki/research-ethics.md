## What is the Research Ethics Board?

If your research involves human participants, you must obtain ethics approval before beginning data collection. Both York and TMU have Research Ethics Boards (REBs) that review research proposals to ensure they meet ethical standards.

## When Do You Need Ethics Approval?

You need REB approval if your research involves:

- Interviews
- Surveys or questionnaires
- Focus groups
- Observation of people
- Analysis of personal data
- Any direct interaction with human participants

You may NOT need REB approval for:

- Textual analysis of published works
- Analysis of publicly available data
- Archival research (depending on content)

When in doubt, consult with your supervisor or the REB office.

## The Application Process

### Before You Apply

- Complete required ethics training (TCPS 2 CORE tutorial)
- Develop your methodology in detail
- Prepare all research instruments (interview guides, surveys, etc.)
- Draft informed consent documents
- Discuss your approach with your supervisor

### The Application

Your application typically includes:

- Description of your research
- Methodology and procedures
- Recruitment strategies
- Informed consent process
- Data storage and security plans
- Risk assessment
- Copies of all research instruments

### Review Process

- **Delegated review**: For minimal risk research, faster turnaround
- **Full board review**: For higher risk research, longer process

### Timeline

Plan ahead! The ethics approval process can take:

- 2-4 weeks for delegated review
- 4-8 weeks for full board review
- Longer if revisions are required

Do not schedule interviews or begin data collection until you have approval.

## Common Issues

### Revisions

Most applications require some revisions. Common issues include:

- Insufficient detail in methodology
- Consent forms that are unclear or too complex
- Inadequate data security plans
- Missing information about risks

### Amendments

If your research changes after approval, you must submit an amendment before implementing changes.
