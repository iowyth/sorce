If your research involves human participants, you must obtain ethics approval before beginning any data collection. Both York and TMU have Research Ethics Boards (REBs) that review research to ensure it meets ethical standards and protects participants.

## When Do You Need Ethics Approval?

### You Need REB Approval If Your Research Involves:

- Interviews (in-person, phone, video)
- Surveys or questionnaires
- Focus groups
- Observation of people (even in public spaces, in some cases)
- Analysis of personal data or records
- Any direct interaction with human participants
- Secondary use of data that contains identifying information

### You May NOT Need REB Approval For:

- Textual analysis of published works
- Analysis of publicly available data (with some exceptions)
- Archival research with historical documents (depending on content)
- Artistic practice that doesn't involve research on human subjects

**When in doubt, consult with your supervisor or the REB office.** It's better to ask than to start research that should have been reviewed.

## Before You Apply

### Complete the TCPS 2 CORE Tutorial

Before submitting an ethics application, you must complete the Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS 2) CORE tutorial. This online course covers the ethical principles that govern research with human participants in Canada.

- [TCPS 2 CORE Tutorial](https://tcps2core.ca/)
- Takes 2-3 hours to complete
- You'll receive a certificate when finished
- Include this certificate with your ethics application

### Prepare Your Materials

Before applying, you'll need:

- Detailed methodology
- All research instruments (interview guides, surveys, etc.)
- Recruitment materials (emails, posters, scripts)
- Informed consent forms
- Data management and security plan
- Risk assessment

### Discuss with Your Supervisor

Go through your ethics application with your supervisor before submitting. They can help you anticipate issues and strengthen your application.

## The Application

### What's Included

Your application typically includes:

- Description of your research and its purpose
- Methodology and procedures
- Participant recruitment strategies
- Informed consent process and forms
- Data storage and security plans
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Copies of all research instruments

### Review Process

- **Delegated review**: For minimal risk research, reviewed by designated REB members. Faster turnaround.
- **Full board review**: For higher risk research (vulnerable populations, sensitive topics, etc.). Reviewed at monthly board meetings.

### Timeline

Plan ahead! The ethics approval process takes time:

- **Delegated review**: 2-4 weeks (if no revisions needed)
- **Full board review**: 4-8 weeks (must align with board meeting schedule)
- **Revisions**: Add additional time if changes are requested

**Do not schedule interviews or begin data collection until you have approval.** Research conducted without ethics approval is a serious violation.

## Common Issues and Revisions

Most applications require some revisions. Common issues include:

- **Insufficient methodological detail**: Be specific about what you'll do
- **Unclear or overly complex consent forms**: Use plain language
- **Inadequate data security plans**: Explain where and how data will be stored
- **Missing information about risks**: Even minimal risk research has some risks
- **Recruitment issues**: Ensure voluntary participation, especially with vulnerable populations

### Amendments

If your research changes after approval (new questions, different participant group, extended timeline), you must submit an amendment before implementing changes.
