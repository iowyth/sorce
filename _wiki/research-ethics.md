People talk about the research ethics board with fear and anxiety. It can often be a mystifying process, with many back and forth interactions that can take many months. Those on the research ethics boards are volunteers, who are attempting to interpret the ethical guidelines of the Tri-Council Policy Statement (TCPS2).

## How to Apply

**Portal:** my.torontomu.ca → "Online Ethics Protocol Submission"

**What to include:** Recruitment notices, consent forms and data collection forms that include surveys, questionnaires and interview guides must be submitted with the application form.

The TCPS2 training is often considered essential for those working in research and may be a requirement when accepting research focused positions.

It may seem like the demands of the research ethics board are set in stone, yet it is important to remember that the board members are still individuals. Considering that they have a limited time to review applications, these volunteers are attempting to interpret and apply complex research ethics protocols to new research. It is possible to present grounded arguments in response to requested revisions, entering into a good faith dialogue around best practices.

The research ethics board, while primarily concerned with ethics, is also interested in protecting the university from complaints and legal blowback from bad studies. Ensuring ethical boundaries in your own studies may benefit from thinking alongside and beyond board recommendations as some methods are unfairly excluded when they upset institutional practices. University regulations regarding community consent may not always take into consideration the complex intersections of committing to ethical praxis within marginalised communities, especially when it comes to who owns the data, who benefits from the research, and who controls what facts are determined? Therefore, it is important to extend ethical considerations beyond the recommendations of the ethics board.

### Considerations Regarding Vulnerable Communities to Which You Are a Member

Volunteer members of the research ethics boards may not understand the ethical nuances of working within marginalised or diverse communities. It may therefore be important to advocate for appropriate ethical approaches, grounded in community standards. Research ethics boards can have their own problems with diversity, and as such, it is important to know that you can guard your community against institutional over-reach by knowing your rights.

## Ethics Applications

**Policy 51:** Ethical conduct for research involving human participants

### Principles

1. **Respect for persons:** respect for autonomy and protecting against diminished autonomy
2. **Concern for welfare:** protecting physical, mental, and spiritual health, and avoiding negative effects and risks
3. **Justice:** treating people equitably and fairly

All research involving human participants that makes reference to Toronto Metropolitan University or uses its resources to carry out research, requires ethics board approval.

> "The ethics review process itself must be fair both in standards and procedures, as well as impartial towards particular proposals and independent of institutional agendas or pressures."

Once you gain approval, it is valid for one year after the original date of approval. After this, you need to submit extensions if the research continues past this date. You can also file changes to your research once in the system. Submitting a final report means that your study is no longer active. This closes your protocol.

## Minimal vs. High Risk Studies

**Minimal risk:** "research in which the probability and magnitude of possible harms implied by participation in the research is no greater than those encountered by participants in those aspects of their everyday life that relate to the research."

Anything beyond this scope is considered to contain risk, with high risk activities being those well beyond the scope of everyday life and especially concerning vulnerable populations, especially when researchers are not themselves part of that population.

## Primary vs. Secondary Data

**Primary data** is data that you personally collect during the course of a study.

**Secondary data** has already been collected by someone else and is publicly available.

## Appeals to REB Decisions

Researchers can appeal within 30 days of receiving notice on an REB decision. If not properly resolved, researchers can write to the Vice-President, Research and Innovation:

## What is NOT Covered by the TCPS2

- Studies based on publicly available information
- Internal evaluations to improve institutional practices
- Research done for other reasons that contribute to generalizable knowledge
- Creative and artistic endeavours not involving human participants

It is possible to create a public performance or creative output and then to analyse that output rather than using the creative process as a study—the output becomes a publicly available media able to be analysed from that angle. To avoid ethics involvement, you cannot collect information on an audience or analyse behaviours ethnographically. You can, however, reflect on your own experiences.
