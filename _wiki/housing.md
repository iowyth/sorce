## Finding Housing

The Toronto rental market is competitive and expensive. Start your search early and be prepared.

### Where to Look

- [Viewit](https://www.viewit.ca/) - Toronto rental listings
- [PadMapper](https://www.padmapper.com/) - Map-based search
- [Kijiji](https://www.kijiji.ca/) - Classifieds (be cautious of scams)
- [Facebook groups](https://www.facebook.com/) - Search for Toronto housing groups
- Departmental listservs - students often post rooms available
- Word of mouth - tell everyone you're looking

### Types of Housing

**Shared Housing / Roommates**
- Most affordable option
- Search for rooms in existing households
- Consider compatibility with housemates

**Apartments**
- Bachelor, 1-bedroom, 2-bedroom, etc.
- Condos vs. purpose-built rentals
- Often require first and last month's rent

**Graduate Residences**
- Limited availability at both York and TMU
- Apply early
- May be good for first year while you learn the city

### Tips for Searching

- Start looking 1-2 months before you need to move
- Be prepared with references, proof of income, and credit check authorization
- Visit in person before signing anything
- Know your rights as a tenant
- Watch for scams - never pay before seeing a unit
