External grants can significantly improve your financial situation during graduate school and strengthen your CV. This section covers major funding opportunities and tips for applying.

## Major Funding Sources

### SSHRC (Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council)

The primary federal funding source for humanities and social sciences research in Canada. Most ComCult students are eligible for SSHRC funding.

#### Canada Graduate Scholarships - Master's (CGS-M)

- **For**: Master's students
- **Amount**: $17,500 for one year
- **Applied through**: Your institution (internal competition first)
- **Deadline**: Usually early December for the following September

#### Canada Graduate Scholarships - Doctoral (CGS-D)

- **For**: Doctoral students
- **Amount**: $35,000/year for 3 years
- **Competitiveness**: Highly competitive (national competition)
- **Deadline**: Usually October

#### SSHRC Doctoral Fellowship

- **For**: Doctoral students
- **Amount**: $40,000/year for 1-3 years
- **Competitiveness**: Less competitive than CGS-D
- **Deadline**: Usually October (same application as CGS-D)

When you apply for CGS-D, you're automatically considered for the Doctoral Fellowship if you don't receive CGS-D.

### OGS (Ontario Graduate Scholarship)

Provincial funding for graduate students studying in Ontario.

- **Amount**: $5,000 per term (up to $15,000/year)
- **For**: Both master's and doctoral students
- **Applied through**: Your institution
- **Deadline**: Varies by institution, usually early spring

### Internal Awards

Both York and TMU offer numerous internal awards and bursaries:

- Entrance scholarships
- Continuing student awards
- Research-specific awards
- Travel grants for conferences
- Need-based bursaries

**Check award databases regularly** — many go unclaimed because students don't know about them or don't apply.

## The Application Process

### Timeline

Most major awards have fall deadlines (September-November) for funding starting the following September. This means:

- **Summer/early fall**: Develop your proposal
- **Fall**: Submit applications
- **Winter/spring**: Results announced
- **Following September**: Funding begins

Start early! Good applications take time.

### Typical Components

Most funding applications include:

- **Research proposal**: What you plan to research and why it matters
- **Personal statement**: Your background, preparation, and goals
- **Transcripts**: Academic record
- **Letters of reference**: Usually 2-3, from people who know your work
- **CV**: Your academic and relevant experience

### Writing a Strong Proposal

Your research proposal is usually the most important part. A strong proposal:

- Has a clear, focused research question
- Explains why the research matters (significance and contribution)
- Describes a feasible methodology
- Shows you know the relevant literature
- Is realistic about timeline and scope
- Is well-written, clear, and error-free

### Getting Feedback

- Ask your supervisor to review drafts well before the deadline
- Use writing center resources if available
- Exchange drafts with other applicants for peer feedback
- Attend workshops on grant writing (check FGS and your department)

## If You Don't Get It

Rejection is common and does not mean your research isn't valuable or that you're not a good scholar.

- Many successful academics were rejected for major grants multiple times
- Read any feedback you receive carefully
- Revise and apply again next year
- Look for alternative funding sources
- Don't let rejection define your self-worth

## Beyond the Big Ones

There are many other funding sources:

- Professional association awards
- Foundation grants (check those relevant to your topic)
- Research-specific grants
- Travel and conference funding
- Awards for specific identity groups or research areas

Ask your supervisor and check with FGS for opportunities you might not know about.
