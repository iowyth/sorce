Graduate school is financially precarious for many students. This section covers funding, budgeting, and resources for when money is tight.

## Funding Packages

ComCult provides funding packages to eligible students. A typical package includes:

- **Base stipend**: A guaranteed amount paid over the year
- **Teaching or research assistantship**: Employment income as part of your funding
- **Tuition bursary or scholarship**: Offsets some or all of tuition

Funding amounts and duration vary by year of study and whether you're MA or PhD. Funding is typically guaranteed for:

- **MA students**: 1-2 years (varies by cohort and admission type)
- **PhD students**: 4-5 years

Consult with the Graduate Program Director about your specific package and what's included.

### Understanding Your Funding Letter

Your funding letter should outline:

- Total guaranteed funding per year
- How it breaks down (stipend, TA/RA, bursary)
- Duration of funding guarantee
- Conditions for maintaining funding
- Tuition and fees information

If anything is unclear, ask the Graduate Program Assistant or Director.

## Managing Your Money

Graduate student funding is often modest, and many students struggle financially. Here are some strategies:

### Budgeting Basics

- Track your income and expenses (apps like Mint or YNAB can help)
- Know when your funding payments arrive (monthly? per term?)
- Plan for irregular expenses: textbooks, conference travel, software
- Build an emergency fund if at all possible, even a small one
- Don't forget about summer: funding may be reduced or structured differently

### Reducing Costs

- Use your student card for discounts everywhere
- Access free resources: libraries, campus events, software, gym
- Consider shared housing to reduce rent
- Use campus food options when they're cheaper
- Take advantage of your health benefits before paying out of pocket

### Additional Income

If you need extra income beyond your funding package:

- **Internal positions**: Additional TA, RA, or GA work (check hour limits)
- **External part-time work**: Check visa restrictions if international
- **Freelance work**: Leverage your skills (writing, editing, tutoring, etc.)
- **Summer employment**: Many students work more during summer when coursework is lighter

## Taxes

### Scholarship and Fellowship Income

- Most scholarship and fellowship income is tax-exempt in Canada
- You'll receive a T4A slip reporting these amounts
- Keep records of education-related expenses

### Employment Income

- TA, RA, and GA income is taxable employment income
- You'll receive a T4 slip
- Taxes may or may not be deducted at source — set aside money if not
- The tuition tax credit can help offset taxes owed

### Getting Help with Taxes

- Free tax clinics are available for students with simple returns
- Many accounting firms offer student discounts
- Software like Wealthsimple Tax (free) can handle most student returns
- University financial services can answer questions

## When Money Is Tight

### Emergency Financial Support

If you're facing financial crisis, there are resources:

- **YUGSA Emergency Bursary**: For York graduate students in crisis
- **Graduate Student Union funds**: TMU graduate students can access support
- **University financial aid offices**: Can connect you with emergency bursaries
- **Food banks**: Both campuses have food banks (see [Food]({{ '/wiki/food/' | relative_url }}))
- **Emergency bursaries**: Check with your program for any available funds

### Don't Be Ashamed

Many graduate students struggle financially. The system is not set up to adequately support us. Accessing support is not a personal failing — it's using resources that exist for exactly this reason.
