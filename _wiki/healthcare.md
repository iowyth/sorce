### Opting Out

If you have equivalent coverage elsewhere (parent's plan, spouse's plan, ODSP, etc.), you may be able to opt out and receive a refund.

**Important:**
- Opt-out deadlines are typically within the **first few weeks of September** — check exact dates each year
- You need proof of alternative coverage
- Once you opt out, you cannot opt back in until the next enrollment period
- Consider carefully — the student plan is often better and cheaper than alternatives
