Welcome to ComCult! While each of us exists at our own unique intersections, going through this program can be challenging in a myriad of ways that affect each of us differently. We may share concerns about our funding, our mental health, our employment prospects, the balance between home and school, how we interact with our supervisors and the university in general. This document was created by students past and present to help you through this program, to let you know that you are not alone in your struggles, and that others have gone before you and made it through in one piece.

This document was created to be a companion guide to the official documents of ComCult, the [ComCult Handbook](https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/communication-and-culture/current-students/program-requirements/), and the [Faculty of Graduate Studies](https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/students/current-students/). This is not an official document, and we strongly recommend going to the source material to make sure that you have the most accurate and up to date information when making decisions about your program.

**This document is collaboratively-edited. If you have any contributions, please make them!**

## Why Is It Called "The Pirate Guide"?

When ComCult was on Google Sites, you were unable to make edits unless you were an administrator of the account. The name speaks to our commitment to enshrine it as a shared resource among the students, for the students, so that all students can have access to all of the information as the need arises. One goal is that all students will pass along what they have learned into this document, so that we can all do a better job of supporting one another through what is one of the most turbulent parts of our professional lives.

## Leaving Something Behind

It is the desire of the current students that all students who leave this program leave behind some of their learnings in this document, so that we all may benefit in the good times, and the hard times. Doing so is a great way to give back while also reflecting on all that you have learned. It is because of students like you, who are reading this document, that it will persist into the future for students, just like you.
