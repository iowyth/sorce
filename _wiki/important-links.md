Communication and Culture is a **joint program between York University and Toronto Metropolitan University**. This means you'll need to navigate systems at both institutions throughout your degree. This page organizes key links to help you find what you need.

## The Joint Program

As a ComCult student, you are a student at both York and TMU. You'll have accounts, access, and responsibilities at both institutions. Your "home" institution is typically determined by your supervisor's affiliation, but you take courses at both, access resources at both, and may need to deal with administration at both.
