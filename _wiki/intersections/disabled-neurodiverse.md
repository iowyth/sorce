### In Graduate School

Graduate accommodations may differ from undergraduate:
- More flexibility in some areas (independent work)
- Less structure in others (self-directed timelines)
- Negotiating with supervisors and committees
- Research-specific accommodations

### Working with Supervisors

- You don't have to disclose everything
- Document agreements in writing

## Tips from Students

- Connect with other disabled/neurodiverse grad students
- Join disability advocacy groups on campus

- Use assistive technology that works for you
- Take breaks when you need them
- Your access needs are valid
