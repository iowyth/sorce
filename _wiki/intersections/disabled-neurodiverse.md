Disabled and neurodiverse students bring valuable perspectives to graduate study while also facing unique challenges. This section gathers resources and advice for navigating the program.

## Recognized Barriers to Education

The [Ontario Human Rights Commission's Policy on accessible education for students with disabilities](https://www.ohrc.on.ca/en/policy-accessible-education-students-disabilities) identifies these barriers:

- Ineffective communication about rights to accommodation and freedom from discrimination
- Inadequate training for education providers on disability-related issues
- Insufficient resources and supports in the classroom
- Long waiting lists for assessments
- Negative attitudes and stereotypes
- Physical inaccessibility
- Inappropriate requests for medical information
- Ineffective dispute resolution processes
- Outright denial of disability-related accommodations

The accommodation of students with disabilities at the post-secondary level is governed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and by provincial human rights statutes. Post-secondary institutions have developed a wide range of delivery methods and structures to meet these obligations.

## Academic Accommodations

### Getting Accommodations

1. Register with disability services at your home institution
2. Provide documentation as required
3. Meet with an advisor to discuss your needs
4. Receive accommodation letters
5. Share letters with instructors/supervisors as needed

### In Graduate School

Graduate accommodations may differ from undergraduate:
- More flexibility in some areas (independent work)
- Less structure in others (self-directed timelines)
- Negotiating with supervisors and committees
- Research-specific accommodations

### Working with Supervisors

- Discuss accessibility needs early
- Advocate for what you need
- You don't have to disclose everything
- Document agreements in writing

## Receiving a Formal Diagnosis

To be registered with accommodation services, you will need a formal medical diagnosis of your disability. If you do not have a diagnosis, they can link you up with a neuro-educational assessment. You can use some of your health coverage or disability funding to receive a formal assessment.

**Getting a diagnosis at York (personal statement):**

> I contacted Student Accessibility Services about my concerns and they applied for the Bursary for Students with Disabilities (BSWD) to get money for a formal assessment. I ended up using $2,000 from my TA benefits and $800 from BSWD to cover this cost. This assessment did not turn out the way I thought it would, so I had to go to a specialist for another assessment.
>
> I used my TA benefits but split it over two years—one appointment in December and one in January—so that it was fully covered (York TA benefits give you a max of $2,000 in one area per calendar year). I got the diagnosis I was expecting and reported it back to SAS, who apologised for me having to get a second assessment and asked about my experiences so they could avoid this happening to others.
>
> There are not many official accommodations, so depending on your diagnosis, they might ask you what would work for you. I was hoping they would have strategies already, but alas!

## Student Accommodation Services

Student accommodations at the graduate level are unevenly approached, often with inadequate provisions for mental health. In your meeting, the support staff may need guidance around what services you require. However, much of your accommodations will come from directly negotiating with your supervisor. While accommodation support workers can write letters to faculty, individual officers do not have enforcement powers.

Specialized technology support officers can orient you to available technological accommodations. You can speak to peer-supports about specific accommodations at the school. You can request peer note-takers for in-person classes.

## Navigating Your Limits

Studying with a disability can be challenging when the road to success is unclear and accommodations are reactive rather than proactive. The responsibility for understanding how to navigate your limits and abilities can be up to you. Staying competitive while facing barriers to success can be an added stressor, where it can feel like we are falling behind.

Making the best use of your talents and abilities can enable those facing barriers to get ahead by leaning into our strengths. Sometimes, following the same routes as the better-abled can mean facing further debility. This means we might need to make our own ways.

## Tips from Students

- Connect with other disabled/neurodiverse grad students
- Join disability advocacy groups on campus
- Build flexibility into your timeline where possible
- Use assistive technology that works for you
- Take breaks when you need them
- Your access needs are valid

## Funding for Students with Disabilities

### Government Funding (OSAP)

If you can apply for OSAP, you can receive funding for disability support services. These have to be applied for through your accessibility services department (not directly through OSAP). You should have someone assigned to you in the accessibility department—they are the one to contact about applying for the BSWD and/or CSG-DSE.

**Maximum funding per academic year:**
- **BSWD:** $2,000
- **CSG-DSE:** $20,000

**[Bursary for Students with Disabilities (BSWD)](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/POCONT1_098083)**
Ontario government funding for disability-related educational expenses (around $2,000 as of 2024). This can cover things like assessment or other required accessibility aids. Apply through your school's accessibility office.

**[Canada Student Grant for Students with Permanent Disabilities](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/education/grants/disabilities.html)**
- Up to **$2,800 per year** (requires a physician to fill out a form)
- Available each year of study as long as you qualify
- Students with disabilities may study part-time while holding an Ontario Graduate Scholarship

**[Canada Student Grant for Services and Equipment (CSG-DSE)](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/POCONT1_098083)**
For disability-related services and equipment. Work with your school's accessibility office to complete the application.

**Bottom line:** You have to apply for OSAP first, then if you qualify, go through the additional process of applying for the disability bursary. You can use the BSWD for costs directly related to your diagnosis/accommodations—therapy, software, an iPad, etc.

If you have never accessed OSAP before, the [OSAP Estimator](https://osap.gov.on.ca/OSAPPortal/en/A-ZListofAid/Estimator/) can help you understand your eligibility without going through the full application process.

## Taking a Medical Leave of Absence

### At TMU

If you get sick during your studies, you may need to take a medical leave of absence. To be granted a leave:

1. Have a medical doctor fill out a **Student Health Certificate**
2. Submit a letter of intent with the length of the leave requested and the reason, including a plan for your return to studies
3. Complete a **Leave of Absence Application** (requires signatures from your supervisor, program chair, and Vice Provost of YSGS)
4. Put a pause on any grant funding you are receiving

**Contact for funding coordination:**
Gino Guercio (Coordinator, Graduate Funding Administration): g2guerci@torontomu.ca

### At York

You can petition for a Leave of Absence on medical (doctor's note required), personal, or compassionate grounds for up to a maximum of three terms.

1. Contact the Graduate Program Director about your request
2. Write a letter outlining the reason and time duration
3. Submit the letter at least one month before the start of the term
4. Contact the Graduate Program Assistant to complete a Petition form

See the [Graduate Petitions Portal](https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/) for step-by-step guidance.
