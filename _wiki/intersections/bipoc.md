Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour (BIPOC) students navigate academia while often facing systemic barriers, microaggressions, and additional labour. 

## Navigating the Academy

Graduate studies in Canada are not neutral spaces. They are embedded in institutions that have historically marginalized Indigenous, Black, and racialized people. While many departments now champion diversity, structural barriers persist: unequal access to mentorship, funding, and networks; underrepresentation in faculty ranks; curricula still anchored in Eurocentric frameworks; and those lacking cultural competency or backgrounds in academia may face exploitation without the ability to strongly advocate for space, credit, and flexibility.

The legacies of white supremacy can make graduate school feel both isolating and conversely hyper-visible for marginalized students. Your identity may be underrepresented in your cohort, and those at the table become expected to speak for their entire community, being careful to sanitize their research for a white audience. Intellectual labour often intersects with emotional labour, especially with work that critiques colonialism, racism, or empire. Presence can be powerful, but not always protected.

Well-meaning scholars may seek to make their own work appear more inclusive without addressing the underlying inequity of institutional life. Even when groups use language around diversity, equity, and inclusion, care and caution are what protect your time and energy. The institution was not designed to support diversity—many academics may unknowingly continue harmful practices that have been normalized.

### Systemic Challenges

BIPOC students often face:

- Underrepresentation in faculty and curricula
- Microaggressions from peers and faculty
- Pressure to represent or speak for entire communities
- Additional emotional and educational labour
- Research being questioned or undervalued
- Isolation in predominantly white spaces

### Strategies for Thriving

Support networks (both formal and informal) remain crucial for marginalized scholars:

- Find or build affinity groups and join faculty-student coalitions
- Learn your rights and know your resources
- **Always document interactions with superiors**, especially when they feel problematic—these documents can later become proof if issues arise
- If you already feel uncomfortable, try to avoid informal conversations where problematic issues can remain ambiguous and where you will not have hard-copies of what is said
- Seek mentors who understand your experience
- Set boundaries around unpaid labour
- Your research and perspectives are valuable

### Racial Battle Fatigue

Coined by W. A. Smith (University of Utah), racial battle fatigue describes the cumulative effects of dealing with racism. Symptoms may include:

**Psychological:** Depression, chronic anxiety, anger, frustration, shock, disturbed sleep, disappointment, resentment, emotional or social withdrawal, intrusive thoughts, avoidance, helplessness, and fear. Acceptance of racist attributions (internalized racism) may also occur.

**Physiological:** High blood pressure, headaches, increased breathing and heart rate in anticipation of racial conflict, upset stomach, ulcers, fatigue, exhaustion, and muscle tension around the neck, shoulders, and head.

**Be kind to yourself.**

### Recognizing White Supremacy Culture

From *Dismantling Racism: A Workbook for Social Change Groups* by Kenneth Jones and Tema Okun:

- Perfectionism
- Sense of Urgency
- Defensiveness
- Quantity over Quality
- Worship of the Written Word
- Paternalism
- Either/Or Thinking
- Power Hoarding
- Individualism
- "Progress" as Bigger, More
- Objectivity
- Right to Comfort

### Excerpts from the Anti-Black Racism Campus Climate Review (TMU)

> "Black faculty participants reported facing burdens associated with being underrepresented in their departments, including disproportionate mentorship responsibilities and greater demands of their time." (p. 7)

> "The broad spectrum of issues articulated involved: a sense of not belonging; lack of representation in the curriculum; safety moving around the campus; underrepresentation of Black faculty; issues with mentorship and problems with front-facing services like Student Life, Student Affairs, Counselling Services, the Human Rights Office, Security Services, etc. Black students made it clear that anti-Black racism is a feature of their experience at Ryerson and they want it to change in a positive way." (p. 9)
