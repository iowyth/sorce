Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour (BIPOC) students navigate academia while often facing systemic barriers, microaggressions, and additional labour. This section gathers resources specific to York and TMU.

## Navigating the Academy

### Systemic Challenges

BIPOC students often face:

- Underrepresentation in faculty and curricula
- Microaggressions from peers and faculty
- Pressure to represent or speak for entire communities
- Additional emotional and educational labour
- Research being questioned or undervalued
- Isolation in predominantly white spaces

### Strategies for Thriving

- Find community with other BIPOC students and faculty
- Seek mentors who understand your experience
- Set boundaries around unpaid labour
- Document incidents when they occur
- Know your resources and rights
- Your research and perspectives are valuable
