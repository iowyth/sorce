Part-time graduate students balance their studies with work, family, or other commitments. This section gathers resources and advice for navigating the program on a part-time basis.

## Choosing Part-Time Study

Students pursue part-time study for many reasons:

- Full-time employment
- Family caregiving responsibilities
- Health considerations
- Financial constraints
- Personal preference

Part-time study is a valid choice and can lead to a successful graduate experience.

## Program Considerations

### Timeline

Part-time study extends your program:

- MA: May take 3-4 years instead of 2
- PhD: May take 6-8+ years instead of 4-5

Discuss realistic timelines with your supervisor and program.

### Funding

Part-time students often face funding challenges:

- Many funding packages are for full-time students only
- Some awards are not available to part-time students
- May need to maintain external employment

Check carefully:
- What funding is available for part-time students
- Whether you can switch between part-time and full-time status
- Impact on your funding if you change status

### Course Scheduling

- Fewer courses per term
- May need to prioritize courses offered at accessible times
- Summer courses may be helpful
- Online/hybrid options where available

## Staying Connected

Part-time students may feel disconnected from their programs. Strategies to stay connected:

- Attend departmental events when possible
- Build relationships with your cohort
- Regular meetings with your supervisor
- Participate in online communities
- Join reading groups or writing groups

## Managing Multiple Commitments

### Time Management

- Block dedicated time for graduate work
- Set realistic weekly goals
- Protect your study time
- Be strategic about when you work on what

### Communication

- Be clear with your supervisor about your availability
- Let employers know about your academic commitments
- Communicate with family about your needs

### Self-Care

- Part-time study is still demanding
- Avoid overloading yourself
- Build in rest and recovery
- Progress may be slow but it's still progress

## When to Consider Changing Status

You might consider switching to full-time if:

- Your circumstances change
- You're nearing comprehensive exams or dissertation
- Funding becomes available
- You want to accelerate your timeline

Discuss options with your supervisor and program director.
