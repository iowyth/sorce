Part-time graduate students balance their studies with work, family, or other commitments. This section gathers resources and advice for navigating the program on a part-time basis.

## Understanding the Part-Time Experience

Many part-time students face limited access to funding, scholarships, and assistantships. Major awards like SSHRC or OGS typically require full-time status, reinforcing a hierarchy of legitimacy tied to institutional support. Even department newsletters, events, and deadlines are often planned with full-time students in mind and may not capture the necessary information and guidance needed for those pursuing studies part-time.

Being part-time can mean falling out of sync with your peers, as you are likely taking fewer courses and rarely overlapping with cohort members. Part-time students often pay more per course while receiving fewer services, like health benefits or access to student union support. Some are excluded from TA/RA roles, professional development programs, or union representation entirely, despite contributing equally when they do participate.

Navigating part-time status can also mean dealing with confusing elements of a bureaucracy not specifically primed for your needs. This might include advisors who don't understand how to process and support your specific timeline, or supervisors who expect full-time outputs. Some policies may also be unclear as to how leave, extensions, or progress reviews specifically apply to your studies. Reaching out to other students and forming supportive networks can help you build resources around your specific needs.

## Choosing Part-Time Study

Students pursue part-time study for many reasons:

- Full-time employment
- Family caregiving responsibilities
- Health considerations
- Financial constraints
- Personal preference

Part-time study is a valid choice and can lead to a successful graduate experience.

## Program Considerations

### Timeline

Part-time study extends your program:

- MA: May take 3-4 years instead of 2
- PhD: May take 6-8+ years instead of 4-5

Discuss realistic timelines with your supervisor and program.

### Funding

Part-time students often face funding challenges:

- Many funding packages are for full-time students only
- Some awards are not available to part-time students
- May need to maintain external employment

Check carefully:
- What funding is available for part-time students
- Whether you can switch between part-time and full-time status
- Impact on your funding if you change status

## Funding Resources

### Course Scheduling

- Fewer courses per term
- May need to prioritize courses offered at accessible times
- Summer courses may be helpful
- Online/hybrid options where available

## Staying Connected

Part-time students may feel disconnected from their programs. Strategies to stay connected:

- Attend departmental events when possible
- Build relationships with your cohort
- Regular meetings with your supervisor
- Participate in online communities
- Join reading groups or writing groups

## Managing Multiple Commitments

### Time Management

- Block dedicated time for graduate work
- Set realistic weekly goals
- Protect your study time
- Be strategic about when you work on what

### Communication

- Be clear with your supervisor about your availability
- Let employers know about your academic commitments
- Communicate with family about your needs

### Self-Care

- Part-time study is still demanding
- Avoid overloading yourself
- Build in rest and recovery
- Progress may be slow but it's still progress

## When to Consider Changing Status

You might consider switching to full-time if:

- Your circumstances change
- You're nearing comprehensive exams or dissertation
- Funding becomes available
- You want to accelerate your timeline

Discuss options with your supervisor and program director.
