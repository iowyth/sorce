First generation students—those who are the first in their families to attend university or pursue graduate studies—bring unique perspectives and face particular challenges. This section gathers resources and advice.

There are several first-generation students and students from working-class backgrounds in graduate programs. There is communication and etiquette that those of us in this category are not aware of. It is often hard to figure out who the other first-generation and working-class students are unless the individual discloses the information.

## What Does "First Generation" Mean?

Definitions vary, but typically refers to students whose parents did not attend university. This might mean:

- First in your family to attend any post-secondary education
- First to attend university (vs. college)
- First to pursue graduate studies

The experience of being first carries with it both pride and unique challenges.

## Navigating the Hidden Curriculum

Graduate school has unwritten rules that students from academic families often learn growing up. As a first-gen student, you may need to actively learn things others take for granted:

### Academic Culture
- How to address professors and supervisors
- What conferences are and why they matter
- How publishing works
- The difference between thesis and dissertation
- What "ABD" means (All But Dissertation)

### Practical Knowledge
- How funding packages work
- The purpose of office hours
- How to ask for letters of reference
- What professional development opportunities to pursue
- How to network at academic events

### Emotional Knowledge
- Imposter syndrome is common and normal
- Asking questions is a strength, not a weakness
- You belong here
- Your perspective is valuable

## Tips from First-Gen Students

**Finding your people:** First, build a support system. This could be a circle of care including friends, faculty mentors, and a community of people outside of academia. You may need to go to these people to reflect and disclose information if your supervisor or committee members do not have the capacity to talk with you as often as you may need.

- Find mentors who understand your experience
- Ask questions—there are no stupid questions
- Connect with other first-gen students
- Celebrate your achievements
- Your family may not understand your work, and that's okay
- Translate academic jargon when talking to family
