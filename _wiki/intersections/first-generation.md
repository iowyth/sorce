First generation students - those who are the first in their families to attend university or pursue graduate studies - bring unique perspectives and face particular challenges. This section gathers resources and advice.

## What Does "First Generation" Mean?

Definitions vary, but typically refers to students whose parents did not attend university. This might mean:

- First in your family to attend any post-secondary education
- First to attend university (vs. college)
- First to pursue graduate studies

The experience of being first carries with it both pride and unique challenges.

## Navigating the Hidden Curriculum

Graduate school has unwritten rules that students from academic families often learn growing up. As a first-gen student, you may need to actively learn things others take for granted:

### Academic Culture
- How to address professors and supervisors
- What conferences are and why they matter
- How publishing works
- The difference between thesis and dissertation
- What "ABD" means (All But Dissertation)

### Practical Knowledge
- How funding packages work
- The purpose of office hours
- How to ask for letters of reference
- What professional development opportunities to pursue
- How to network at academic events

### Emotional Knowledge
- Imposter syndrome is common and normal
- Asking questions is a strength, not a weakness
- You belong here
- Your perspective is valuable

## Tips from First-Gen Students

- Find mentors who understand your experience
- Ask questions - there are no stupid questions
- Connect with other first-gen students

- Your family may not understand your work, and that's okay
- Translate academic jargon when talking to family
