## Navigating Graduate School as a Queer Student

- Academic settings vary widely in acceptance

### Finding Community

- 2SLGBTQIA+ student groups on campus
- Queer faculty and graduate students
- Community organizations off campus
- Online communities and networks

### Research and Scholarship

- Queer studies is a thriving field
- Many scholars incorporate queer perspectives across disciplines
- Find faculty working on related topics
- Attend conferences and events in your areas
