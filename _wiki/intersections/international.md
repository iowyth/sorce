International students face unique challenges navigating Canadian academia, immigration requirements, and living far from home. This section gathers resources and advice.

## Immigration and Visas

### Study Permits

Your study permit is your most important document. Keep track of:

- Expiry date
- Conditions on your permit
- Renewal requirements

### Renewal

Apply to renew your study permit **well before** it expires:

- Processing times vary (check current estimates)
- You can remain in Canada while renewal is processing if you applied before expiry
- Keep proof of application

### Work Authorization

**On-Campus Work**
- Usually permitted on study permit
- Check your permit conditions

**Off-Campus Work**
- May be permitted for up to 20 hours/week during semester
- Check IRCC regulations and your permit conditions
- Full-time work may be permitted during scheduled breaks

**Co-op Work Permits**
- Required if doing paid internships as part of program
- Apply before starting work

## Funding for International Students

International students face higher tuition and may have fewer funding options:

### Internal Funding
- Some departmental funding available
- International student-specific awards
- Graduate assistantships (TA, RA, GA)

### External Funding
- Some SSHRC programs open to permanent residents only
- Check eligibility carefully before applying
- Look for awards specifically for international students

### Tuition Costs
International tuition is significantly higher. Budget carefully and:
- Apply for all available awards
- Look for fee waivers
- Consider RA positions that may include tuition support

## Living in Canada

### Health Insurance

International students are typically not eligible for OHIP immediately. You must have:

- UHIP (University Health Insurance Plan) - mandatory
- Extended coverage through student union health plans

### Banking

- Open a Canadian bank account
- Student accounts often have no fees
- Bring immigration documents to the bank

### Housing

See the [Housing]({{ '/wiki/housing/' | relative_url }}) section, and also consider:
- Temporary housing while you search
- Homestay programs
- International student housing resources

### Cultural Adjustment

Moving to a new country is challenging. Give yourself time to adjust:
- Connect with other international students
- Join cultural groups on campus
- Explore your new city
- It's okay to feel homesick
