International students face unique challenges navigating Canadian academia, immigration requirements, and living far from home. This section gathers resources and advice.

## Immigration and Visas

### Study Permits

Your study permit is your most important document. Keep track of:

- Expiry date
- Conditions on your permit
- Renewal requirements

### Renewal

Apply to renew your study permit **well before** it expires:

- Processing times vary (check current estimates)
- You can remain in Canada while renewal is processing if you applied before expiry
- Keep proof of application

### Work Authorization

**On-Campus Work**
- Usually permitted on study permit
- Check your permit conditions

**Off-Campus Work**
- May be permitted for up to 20 hours/week during semester
- Check IRCC regulations and your permit conditions
- Full-time work may be permitted during scheduled breaks

**Co-op Work Permits**
- Required if doing paid internships as part of program
- Apply before starting work

## Funding for International Students

International students face higher tuition and may have fewer funding options:

### Internal Funding
- Some departmental funding available
- International student-specific awards
- Graduate assistantships (TA, RA, GA)

### External Funding
- Some SSHRC programs open to permanent residents only
- Check eligibility carefully before applying
- Look for awards specifically for international students

### Tuition Costs
International tuition is significantly higher. Budget carefully and:
- Apply for all available awards
- Look for fee waivers
- Consider RA positions that may include tuition support

## Living in Canada

### Health Insurance

International students are typically not eligible for OHIP immediately. You must have:

- UHIP (University Health Insurance Plan) - mandatory
- Extended coverage through student union health plans

### Banking

- Open a Canadian bank account
- Student accounts often have no fees
- Bring immigration documents to the bank

### Housing

See the [Housing]({{ '/wiki/housing/' | relative_url }}) section, and also consider:
- Temporary housing while you search
- Homestay programs
- International student housing resources

### Cultural Adjustment

Moving to a new country is challenging. Give yourself time to adjust:
- Connect with other international students
- Join cultural groups on campus
- Explore your new city
- It's okay to feel homesick

## Navigating Canadian Culture

Canadian culture has a strange mix of formal and informal hierarchies that can often remain intentionally vague. The desire to remain egalitarian (at least on the surface) is an important part of Canadian culture, with a focus on politeness and harmony. There is a desire to avoid ruffling feathers that can become nearly pathological—Canadians are often strongly committed to lining up for things and can get really miffed when people cut in line.

### Communication Styles

Certain cultural forces involve aspects of "Guess/Ask/Tell" culture, where widely different approaches to cultural harmony can involve unspoken rules. Some people expect others to guess how they are feeling, to ensure that everyone is comfortable. Guess cultures can put pressure when diversity is at play, when it can be difficult to assume what others need. Establishing a norm around telling each other what we need can reduce difficulties, but may go against the deep programming of some Canadians who were taught that it is rude to state such things openly.

Manners widely vary between situations. While some people may be sticklers for tardiness and always shake hands upon meeting, other communities may be more informal, instead asking to hug when greeting. Anglo-Canadians rarely kiss in social situations but French Canadians often do a customary double cheek kiss when greeting or departing.

### Regional Differences

There are distinct cultural differences between urban and rural Canadian cultures as well as East Coast, The Prairies, and the West Coast. Being "laid back" means very different things for people from the North, East, and West where informality takes on distinctly different tones.

**French Canadian culture** is more recognizably European in nature. French Canadians tend to respect efforts made to understand and value their culture, including attempts at learning the French language. As Canada has two official languages, learning French can be a strength when applying to governmental positions.

**Ontario** is known as a hub of business, technology, and entertainment industries. Torontonians can develop a reputation a bit like Parisians—outside of Toronto, animosity towards "city folk" can prevail amongst the rural and working classes.

### Working with Professors

Professors are usually called by their first names in Canada, and may be open to a more collaborative relationship with students, where strict hierarchical standards are often considered somewhat regressive. Some professors may, however, attach specific importance to formalisms such as referring to them by their last name and title as Dr. or Professor. If in doubt, ask what a professor prefers before initiating informal contact.

### Understanding Canadian Anxieties

Canadians can appear really rattled by disagreement or disharmony but are also relatively quick to get over slights, because after all, we want to remain chill. This strange desire to maintain chill at all costs can make some dynamics strangely fraught with tension, where people don't know where they stand but it is difficult to clarify this without fraying people's nerves. The trick to navigating these dynamics is to keep things light and positive. It can be helpful to be reassuring while discussing conflicts.

## Graduate Housing at York

Most international students in joint programs like ComCult are registered on the York side. York is the only side that provides housing for international students. You can apply for housing if registered on the York side only.

The housing is located on the York campus, about a 50-minute train ride to downtown Toronto. Large grocery stores are not walking distance—most students share a car or order delivery. The subway is on campus and about a 10-minute walk from the graduate student housing. York Lanes is a small "mall" on campus with restaurants, a coffee shop, pharmacy, and small convenience store.

## Important Administrative Information

### Social Insurance Number (SIN)

Those who are new to working in Canada will need to apply for a SIN number—this is your government tax number. TA, RA, and other jobs require your SIN number.

**[Apply for your SIN here](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/apply.html)**

It is free to apply. However, you must have a mailing address to apply. If you need to apply before you have a mailing address, contact your program administration for assistance.

### Taxes

York University offers free tax services for international students. Check if you qualify through [York International](https://yorkinternational.yorku.ca/). Some students with children and a working spouse may not qualify—[H&R Block](https://www.hrblock.ca/) is an affordable and trustworthy outside service.

### Quirks of York International Student Funding

York international student funding works differently from domestic students. Three times a year, an amount (around $1,194) is deposited into your student account and then to your bank account. This amount is the same for years 1-3; year 4 it increases to around $1,424.

**Important:** Watch for this amount each term. Once deposited into your bank account, **you must e-transfer it back to York University.** If you do not e-transfer it back, you will accrue interest and may not be registered. Contact **Stephanie Wong at wongs@yorku.ca** for explanation of your student account—she works directly with graduate international students and funding.

### Cultural Connections Program

York offers a [Cultural Connections Program](https://yorkinternational.yorku.ca/) to help international students connect with Canadian culture and other international students
