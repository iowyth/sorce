## What is the Dissertation Proposal?

The dissertation proposal outlines your research plan. It demonstrates that you have:

- A clear and viable research question
- Familiarity with relevant literature
- An appropriate methodology
- A realistic timeline

The proposal is typically developed after comprehensive exams and must be approved by your committee before you can proceed with your research.

## Components of a Proposal

While formats vary, most proposals include:

### Introduction
- Research question(s)
- Significance of the study
- Overview of the project

### Literature Review
- Key conversations in your field
- Gaps your research addresses
- Theoretical framework

### Methodology
- Research design
- Data collection methods
- Analysis approach
- Ethical considerations

### Timeline
- Realistic schedule for completion
- Key milestones

### Bibliography
- Sources consulted and anticipated

## Length

Proposals typically range from 20-50 pages, though this varies by field and committee expectations. Consult with your supervisor about appropriate length.

## The Proposal Defense

Most proposals are defended orally before your committee. This meeting is an opportunity to:

- Present your research plan
- Receive feedback and suggestions
- Clarify your approach
- Demonstrate your readiness to proceed

### Preparing for the Defense

- Know your proposal inside and out
- Anticipate questions and objections
- Practice your presentation
- Prepare to discuss alternatives and limitations
- Remember: your committee wants you to succeed

### After the Defense

Possible outcomes:

- Approval to proceed
- Approval with revisions
- Major revisions required
- Resubmission required

Most students pass with minor or moderate revisions. Incorporate feedback and get final approval before beginning your research.

## Ethics Approval

If your research involves human participants, you will need ethics approval from the Research Ethics Board. See the [Research Ethics]({{ '/wiki/research-ethics/' | relative_url }}) section for more information.
