The dissertation proposal outlines your research plan and demonstrates that you are ready to undertake dissertation research. It is developed after comprehensive exams and must be approved by your committee.

## What Is a Dissertation Proposal?

The proposal is a document that:

- Articulates your research question(s)
- Situates your project within relevant scholarly conversations
- Describes your methodology and theoretical framework
- Outlines your chapter structure
- Presents a realistic timeline

Think of it as a contract between you and your committee about what your dissertation will do.

## Components of a Proposal

While formats vary based on your field and committee preferences, most proposals include:

### Introduction

- Clear statement of your research question(s)
- Significance of the study — why does this matter?
- Overview of the project and its contributions
- What gap or problem you're addressing

### Literature Review

- Key conversations in your field
- How your work relates to existing scholarship
- Gaps your research addresses
- Your theoretical framework and key concepts

### Methodology

- Research design and approach
- Data collection methods (if applicable)
- Analysis approach
- Materials you'll be working with
- Ethical considerations
- Limitations and scope

### Chapter Outline

- Proposed chapter structure
- Brief description of each chapter's content and argument
- How chapters build on each other

### Timeline

- Realistic schedule for completion
- Key milestones (chapter drafts, ethics approval, etc.)
- Any constraints (funding end date, life circumstances)

### Bibliography

- Sources consulted and anticipated
- Usually 50-100+ sources

## Length

Proposals typically range from 20-50 pages, though this varies significantly. Some committees want comprehensive documents; others prefer concise statements. Consult with your supervisor about appropriate length and depth for your committee.

## The Proposal Defense

Most proposals are defended orally before your committee. This meeting is an opportunity to:

- Present your research plan
- Receive feedback and suggestions
- Clarify your approach
- Discuss potential challenges
- Demonstrate your readiness to proceed

### Preparing for the Defense

- Know your proposal thoroughly
- Anticipate questions and objections
- Prepare a brief presentation (10-20 minutes, unless told otherwise)
- Prepare to discuss alternatives and limitations
- Have honest answers about things you're still figuring out
- Remember: your committee wants you to succeed

### During the Defense

- Listen carefully to questions
- Take notes on feedback
- Ask for clarification if needed
- It's okay to say "I don't know, but here's how I might find out"
- Treat it as a collaborative conversation

### After the Defense

Possible outcomes:

- **Approved**: You're ready to proceed!
- **Approved with minor revisions**: Small changes needed, then proceed
- **Major revisions required**: More substantial work before approval
- **Resubmission required**: Significant reconceptualization needed (rare)

Most students pass with some revisions. Incorporate committee feedback and get final approval before beginning your dissertation research.

## Ethics Approval

If your research involves human participants, you will need ethics approval from the Research Ethics Board **before** you begin data collection. See the [Research Ethics]({{ '/wiki/research-ethics/' | relative_url }}) section for more information.

Start the ethics process early — it can take several months.
