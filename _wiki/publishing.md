Publishing is an important activity for those who want to pursue a career as an academic. There can be a rather toxic dynamic of "publish or perish" amongst academic scholars that can lead to toxic productivity culture and interpersonal competition, so we can also think about it as "connect and thrive". We all need to develop productive relationships with those we can converse and work with, including as co-authors and collaborators. These relationships are vitally important to the development of a network and this can lead to opportunities in the future. For example, gathering together scholars into edited collections is only possible when scholars form networks, where strong scholarship can be drawn together into larger volumes.

Many people start out by publishing a book review in a more accessible journal. You may be able to get access to free books when doing such a review, especially through informal channels. There are many open-source publications that will enable you to get your work out there, while also being accessible to early career academics. The "impact factor" is one way to assess the importance of a publication but citations aren't always a marker of importance. Often peer-reviewed journals are considered more reputable, merely due to their more rigorous refinement process.

Open-access journal articles are the easiest research to access and can be most effectively communicated beyond the borders of the academy. Many journals have been advocating for more open-source sharing of publicly funded knowledge as a contribution to the public good. It is also to the benefit of early career academics to be able to share their publications with as wide an audience as possible in order to maximise their potential impact. Forging coalitions within smaller publishing circles, with local independent journals can also be a way of forming new ways of working and thinking. Engaging in strong relationship building can lead to long-term sustainable working dynamics that lead to greater success through investment in community infrastructures. For marginalised scholars, these networks are all the more vital when facing institutional pushback and discrimination.

## Submitting a Paper for Peer-Review

You can create an account with an academic journal and submit a paper through their system. Different journals will have different processes for this, so be sure to read through their submissions page to flag formatting considerations, journal scope, and other relevant details. Different journals use different forms of citation, for example, and will expect submitted papers and manuscripts to adhere to their internal standards.

Once you have submitted a paper to a peer-reviewed journal, it will then be sent to be reviewed, often by two reviewers with expertise in your area of research. This can take literally forever. Certain journals can take years between submission and publication. For this reason, you need to manage invitations to revise and resubmit, which can sometimes come back at inconvenient times with the expectation of a quick turnaround.

### Possible Outcomes

- **Rejected** (womp-womp)
- **Substantially revise:** you need major structural changes, but if you can successfully make these, you may be accepted upon resubmission
- **Revise and resubmit:** there are minor issues, but if you can fix these, it is likely you will be accepted
- **Accepted:** a highly unlikely outcome, sort of like a unicorn

### Responding to Reviewers

You will need to respond to reviewer critiques. It can be helpful to go through the critiques systematically, separating them out into a document that lists each critique as an action point. As you respond to the critique, you may want to include specific snippets of your text into this separate document. This allows reviewers to quickly see how and where you have responded to their critiques. This can lead to them feeling less stressed out by you, and they might be more favourable to your work for this reason.

After you have finished your revisions, you will re-submit your piece, including the document you have drafted to reply to reviewer critiques. After this, if you need to do further revisions, this may be allowed, but it may also lead you to be conditionally rejected with an invitation to submit at a later date.

## Publishing a Book

You can publish your Master's Thesis, Dissertation, or other work by turning it into a book. If you have a contact at a publishing house, you would ideally send them an inquiry with a short proposal. You might want to include a table of contents, with short descriptions of each chapter, as well as a sample chapter. For cold submissions, you will need to review the publisher's website and adhere to their desired formats. This can be anywhere from submitting the full manuscript to a similar query with a table of contents and sample chapter.

Publishers will often be interested in your proposed audience, similar books in your field, why you want to publish with them specifically, and any plans you may have for the promotion of your work. Search their back catalogues for work that might be similar to your own. It may be helpful to demonstrate how your work would add to their catalogue, extending or changing what they are already offering.

This proposal is often something that is sent out to reviewers who may then have comments on the scope and focus of your publication. This may require you to change the framing of the overall book, adding or subtracting things that may make it a stronger publication (at least in their opinion). You would then be asked to resubmit your proposal with a changed framing.

A **monograph** is a book published under one author, but other popular formats are books containing a collection of essays written by different people with an editor or group of editors who work to make this a cohesive whole. These editors will often write a preface and/or introduction to the collection that gives the book its shape. The only thing you need to create such a book is a solid network and a good idea that draws the interest of those working on the problem. This can be a great way to gather strength in numbers.

Another way to do this, is to work collaboratively between several authors on one text, so each author might contribute to parts or to the whole text. This requires much more detailed collaborative work, but these kinds of efforts are drawing attention and can be a good way to leverage multiple viewpoints and areas of expertise to create a better book overall. For example, if a social scientist paired up with a data scientist, they could work together to create compelling data visualizations of social phenomena.

### Updating Your Thesis/Dissertation Format

The thesis/dissertation format is a bit too on the nose for publishers and so, it is likely that you will have to change the format to be more approachable to readers. A thesis will often have a literature review and methodology section. These can become part of an introductory chapter. Rewriting these sections to appeal to lay readers, means making the language more simple and straight-forward, avoiding jargon and making the work more approachable. This may then mean attempting to think through your audience, why they are reading your book, and what is important to tell this audience about your approach. Why would this approach speak to them? What can you say about your methods that would take them out of academia and into the wider world? It can be helpful to think of how to ground your work in a human way.

Thinking through the narrative of the overall work can also be helpful. To reach a wider audience, you are going to be guiding them through your process and findings. Establishing a narrative throughout can help readers to move through this in an easier way. Establishing a narrative can also help to make your writing more engaging. This may be helpful to keep in mind when you are writing your dissertation, as creating approachable and grounded work that engages in a clear narrative can also help others to understand and apply the knowledge you are sharing.

Great resources for making your research more publishable are these books by William Germano: *Getting it Published* and *From Dissertation to Book*.
